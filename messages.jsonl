We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. Violent clashes have broken out between white nationalists and counter-protests there. Racism and miscarriage of justice tear apart. After the acquittal of white officers, he mercilessly beat Rodney King with an injurious lie. After the death of Michael Brown. A Ku Klux Klan rally in Dayton today sparked lots of controversy. For Yvonne Martin. The Breonna Taylor class march. A history of brutality and misconduct. Restrained by officers screaming, I can't breathe. My four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. I have a dream today. Good morning. How is everybody doing on this morning? Y'all all right? You can do better than that. Hey. Y'all all right? I know I'm not Chris. I know that might be so shocking for many of you, but no, not him. It is my honor to be before you. I am Robert Lyons from the Marketplace Movement where I serve as a senior leader there. And I am definitely honored and privileged to stand before this great church on this morning as we are in week two of this series, this week two of this series on broken records. And when Chris asked me to come and stand before you, of course, always honored to be able to minister the word of the Lord. And I told him, I said, I'd be more than happy to come, more than happy to come as long as you let me just preach the gospel as long as I'm not there to you know do a poetry reading just let me come preach the gospel and I'll be more than happy to come and he and I continue to develop such a fresh and genuine relationship I've been honored to meet the staff here. And as we go into this series, I know I got the opportunity to hear your pastor preach on last week and open this series for you guys. And this is an intense subject. This is one of those subjects where everybody goes, Oh no, not that one. You know, that subject where it's like, are we really? Oh God, yes we are. We're trying to talk about that. And I remember I got an email from Chris a couple of days ago and he says, \"'Hey Robert, feel free to not really dress up.' And I said, great, I'll wear my clergy collar.\" His response, wonderful, I was hoping you would do that. Because I think it's imperative to start this way because this is who I am this is not like this is not dressed up this is me and a part of this phenomenal series and a part of the beauty of this series is for us to learn what it means to accept everyone as they are. So, if I was preaching at home this morning, I would look like this because this is who I am. No, no, you know, costume, no mask, no dress up. As a matter of fact for me, this is dressed down. You should see me dressed up. And as we come to this series on broken records, I don't know if any of you have record players. I know they're a little nostalgic these days. I happen to like the sound of vinyl. It's a phenomenal sound that is very difficult to capture. And because I have a background in music, my wife and I have this phenomenal collection of vinyl records that we love, and that we'll play the vinyl. And there are actually records that we have on vinyl. We prefer those instead of saying like, hey Siri, play. I'm sorry, I'm gonna trigger somebody's phone. Instead of saying that, we'd actually put the vinyl record, my phone got triggered. We'll put the record on and let it play. And there's something interesting about vinyl. As I was preparing for this series, one of the most expensive records ever sold was the Beatles album. It was actually one of their own records that they actually own, and it sold for some ridiculous, like almost a million dollars for this record but here's a here's a challenging thing about records broken records skip I don't know maybe you know show of hands I can see you guys how many of you have records at home wonderful the rest of you are like record what is this new thing? Broken records skip. It doesn't even have to be all the way broken, but you know, when you get to that part of the record, as Pastor Chris said last week, where the needle can't get in the groove. And what happens is, because it can't settle into how it was made, because it can't settle into how it was made, it ends up skipping. Here's the problem with a skipping record. It'll give you a false impression of what's actually on it. You hear one part of the song, I don't know if you've ever had your favorite record skip, but it gets right to the part where you really like it. I mean that part where you're gonna belt it out right there in the shower and then skip. Oh. Now I can't experience the best part of the record because it's broken. But not only do broken records skip, broken records get stuck. That stuck record is that part of the record where it just kind of continues to play the same thing over and over and over again. You guys know how a broken record can do. over and over and over again. You guys know how a broken record can do. Sometimes it gets so stuck that it just stays, stays, stays, stays, stays, right? And you're hoping, come on, move on. You know, back in the day, you know, if anybody knows about jukeboxes, when the jukebox would get stuck, you'd go and bump it hoping it would just move on to the next part but thirdly thirdly broken records lose value and so because this record is broken you know one of my favorite records is the Miles Davis record that has Kinda Blue on it. It's one of my favorites. Now, that record is one of the greatest selling records of all time, or let me get a little bit more mainstream, Michael Jackson's record with Thriller. Thriller, the highest grossing records of all time. But the record has no value if it's broken. It loses all of what it's worth. Nobody's gonna go and pay full price for a broken record. So the question this morning is what do I do? What do I do with this broken record? What should my response be if I have this simple piece of vinyl that is broken? Now, any of my DIYers out there, I'm sure that you're already scrolling through Pinterest in your mind, and you're coming up with all types of phenomenal things that you can do with this broken vinyl but there's a couple of things we keep them for nostalgia you take this record and you know it doesn't play anymore so you don't play it you just keep it in the dust jacket and you say oh remember this one some of us probably right now in a record collection that you haven't played in a decade you have some records that you know skip but you keep them because you can remember how they used to sound or if we don't keep them for nostalgia we attempt to repurpose those records my daughter my middle daughter is an artist and I remember her coming down to my record collection and she said, dad, show me the one you don't use anymore. I'm going to paint on it. She took the record and by the time it was done, she had a wonderful sunset on the record. She painted another one with snow-capped mountains. It was beautiful. She repurposed it. Or the record that you really liked that doesn't play anymore, you can try to buy it again. You go to store, you scour. Do you have that one record? Do you have that one record? Because we're trying to relive the sound. And then there's the last piece. Throw it away. Doesn't play anymore? Throw it away. It's no good. After all, I can get it on digital. I got a subscription, Spotify. All right? Who needs all this record business? Spotify doesn't break. I just play it whenever I feel like. Now, we're talking about records, objects. But how does the decision change when the record is a life? How does the decision change when this one of a kind life is broken? What if I'm the broken record? What if you're the broken record? What if your loved one is the broken record? How do we process this when this broken record that we're talking about through this series is people? that we're talking about through this series is people. People who we see every day. People who we interact with on a daily basis. Well, if it's a person, my broken life can skip. This creates a problem because here it is when you have a broken record that is a broken one-of-a-kind life and I start skipping you only hear portions of my story and because you only hear portions of my story you do not get to hear the beauty of my song portions I'm skipping there's something wrong with me and the danger is you'll evaluate the quality of the record based upon the fact that you're only listening to it in its broken state broken lives get stuck I would say before you guys this morning this is where we are many Many broken lives that are stuck. I'm sick of hearing about, insert drama here. I don't want to hear about racial reconciliation anymore. I can't wait till this election is over. I can't wait. Let's just get past it. I'm tired of hearing about it. One more news cycle. I don't want to hear about it anymore. But here's the thing. Regardless of how we feel, somebody is broken over very real circumstances and they're stuck. They have to keep talking about it because the groove is broken. They just want somebody to hear their song, but they're stuck. They're broken by very real circumstances. Broken by very real mentalities. And listen to this point that I will make to you guys. Perception is a reality, but not absolute truth. Just because I don't experience it doesn't mean that the experience is not real. Someone else's perception is their reality, so their brokenness, even though we may not experience it, is a brokenness that we all must feel. Don't evaluate the quality of the record just because it's broken but how about this these broken lives these broken records of lives these one-of-a-kind lives seem less valuable they're just less valuable when we get tired of hearing of it when we get tired of hearing of it, when we get tired of experiencing it, then we start saying things like, it doesn't take all of that. It doesn't have to be that big of a deal. It has to be better now, right? It's better now right it can't be still this bad right right There's no way that the experiences are as bad as what they make it, right? Well, you look pretty intelligent, Robert, and I know your experiences have been good, right? Right? Or is my reality that God has just allowed me to look at it a little differently? I can't count the number of times that I've been pulled over. I wish I could. It always gives the police officer this wonderful little chuckle when he rolls down, when I roll down my window and he sees me like this. He normally begins to stutter over his words. Uh, uh, uh, uh, father? Uh, uh, uh, father? Oh, does that happen to you? Sure. But do you protest? Do you get angry? Or do you want change? Do you want a solution? Oh, there he goes. Everything was okay until he got to that point. Everything was all right. Do we keep the broken pieces? Do we? Do we just keep them? You know, it's broken, but at least we can say we kept them. That's what I see, you know, oftentimes going on, even in the body of Christ. Let's not fix it. Let's just keep it. We don't want to do anything about it. We just want to keep it there. And so we can say, look, we own the record. It doesn't play anymore. It's not valuable to us anymore, but we kept it. This is what happens when simply we're checking off the box. Black History Month program, check. Diversity and inclusion, check. We're just keeping to pieces. We don't wanna put people back together again, or do we? This is why I was so willing to come because your pastor wants this thing to look like the church. This is why I was so willing to stand on this stage because he wants fearless to be fearless he wants to be the visible representation of Christ in the earth he wants your church to look like the church Galatians would tell us it's not on the screen it's just in me there is no difference male nor female we're all one in Christ Jesus no Jew no Gentile no bond no Greek no black no white no east side no west side no north no south just do you love Jesus? No rich, no poor, no Democrat, no Republican, none of that. Do you love Jesus? Do we keep these broken pieces or, or do we allow them to just be repurposed? Because this is equally dangerous stop talking about all of this reconciliation stuff just come over here and do this other job where you can be quiet and be happy this even more dangerous this doesn't fix anything the wonderful repurposed record that my that my daughter did it's beautiful but it's no longer a record let me say something pretty strong right here buckle up don't repurpose me if the only way that we can have a relationship is if I am repurposed to match what makes you feel comfortable, you don't love me. Don't repurpose me. It's one of the reasons why I didn't jean and tee-shirted today. Because that would have been repurposing me. I love you because of who you are. You don't have to be repurposed. The moment that Chris steps into my church, can't wait to have him. The moment that he steps into my church to preach, I hope it comes just like this. Shirt tail out. Casual pants. Hey. Just like that. Just like that. Because we want to hear the gospel, not like that. Just like that. Because we want to hear the gospel, not his personality. Don't repurpose me. Don't say, oh, you're nice as long as you match my view of what nice is. As long as you like what I like and do what I do and only say the things that I like you to say, we can get along. But should we not rally around the central cause of Jesus? Jesus. Jesus. Should that not be our aim? Or do we just throw away the broken pieces? I've alluded to this. Broken records still retain their pre broken song somewhere in all of your broken friends there's a there's a song waiting to be heard somewhere in all of your broken co-workers there's a song waiting to be heard I know I'm looking at you right now. Please get to the scripture. Please come on, get to it. No, I'm preaching. Really, I am. Because restoration of a broken record is through Jesus. Not through a program. Not through a rally. Jesus. Not through a nice little kumbaya. Jesus. That's what I believe. Jesus, who's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think. Jesus, who was able to take himself off of the throne, minimize himself to an embryo, come through Mary, go through life, then all of a sudden grow himself up, bring himself to a cross, and allow himself to go to sleep on the cross, wake up on the third day, and still go back to himself with all power in his hand. Jesus. This means that anyone who belongs to christ second corinthians 5 made it to the scripture anyone who belongs to christ has become a new person listen to that anyone i preach at a talk back to me church say anyone great anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person the old life gone a new life has begun show of hands how many of you have made some mistakes in your life keep them up how many of you got some stuff you're not proud of hmm how many of you have made some mistakes in your life? Keep them up. How many of you got some stuff you're not proud of? How many of you are grateful that Jesus was able to wipe that thing away? Okay, now put those hands down. Jesus' ability to wipe the old away has nothing to do with how we look. So if He can make you new, he can make me new. This is where we rally together. If anyone, it doesn't say if Republicans, Democrats, black, white, rich, poor, it doesn't say that. Anyone in the Hebrew, the Greek, the Aramaic, the Ebonics, or the hood means anyone. Anyone is in Christ but his work capital H the Lord's work requires our participation all of us wouldn't it be nice if we got frustrated and we just turned the TV off and said, over it, over it. But I thought we were Christians. Go into all the world, preach the gospel. Not my job. That's Christian's job. No, not according to 2 Corinthians. Here's the truth. I see some of you taking notes. Makes my heart happy. Many of us like Jesus. We just don't want to be like Jesus. Oh, we like him. Oh, Jesus is great. Some of you right here, you have a Jesus is my homeboy shirt. You like Jesus. You just don't want to be like Jesus yes I do sure are you sure you want to be like him who reclined with the sinners and the publicans who was around people that nobody else wanted to be around who took the religious standards of the day and and turned them on their head and shook them? Jesus The one who was like this is the way you've been doing it, but I say Jesus The one who walked into the average church and turned the tables over and said I'm sick of this Jesus The one who was like oh, you're not good enough come here. Let me make you better Jesus The one who took the woman caught in adultery and said, I don't condemn you either. Jesus. The one who wouldn't see what color I am. Jesus. The one who doesn't care where I'm from. Jesus. The one who only wants to hear us minister the gospel. Jesus. Who called us all to be together and do his work. Jesus. Do we want to just, you know, sing songs about him, or do we want to be like him? Do we want to just come to a great building like this and say, I go to fearless church, high five for us, or do we want to be like Jesus, taking drastic stands in which the world knows that there is light in the earth? Be like Jesus. Look at this verse. This is verse 18 and 19. All of this is a gift from God. I love it. All of it's a gift from God who brought us back to himself through Christ. God has given us, say us. Thank you. Us, this task of reconciling people. To who? To him. For God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people's sins against them. He gave, what's that next word? Us. Man, this us thing is getting us this wonderful message of reconciliation we also means me i don't get it i was talking to my father my father's 75 years old he grew up in a little town called Duncan Oklahoma and he was asking me where I would preach today and I said this statement to my father I said we means me and my father you know still sharp in his mind still pastoring he says huh that's good son just turn that W around and it didn't hit me at first. We means me. There's a me in every we. There's a me in every we. It's just a shifting of one letter. He said, oh, you just flip it. But we don't like that. Some of us are stuck in the me, and some of us only like the we if it has nothing to do with us. You know, the we. Change that. You over there, don't ask me to do anything with that. We need change over there. Poor things, that needs to be changed over there. Yeah, well, what are you going to do to change it? No, had nothing to do with me. I don't live over there. That's so sad that that happened over there. Well, what are you going to do about it? I don't live over there. That's so sad that that happened to them. What are you going to do about it? I'm not them. But I thought we were one body. Many members. We're the body of Christ, not the individual of Christ. So we're Christ's ambassadors. Verse 20. God making his appeal through us. God making his appeal through us. God making his appeal through us. God making his appeal through you. Every last one of us. We speak for Christ when we plead come back to God you know what I would say as I stand before you guys I'm pleading for us to come back to God Jesus is the only one that can fix this come back to God so that we look like the Scripture, so that we look like His glorious bride. Everybody should be looking at everybody and saying, please, y'all, come back to God. When we hear that locker room talk, that water cooler talk that you know is so outside of God you should be pleading with them come on come back to God Chris asked me he says well what can I do I said you have ears people listen to you that won't listen to me so maybe if they hear things coming out your mouth because they've already given you access we can come together this is how we are the body of Christ this is what Jesus died for this is what he died for for the church to be one. Well, you know, it's not our fault. It's not our fault it's divided. Yes, it is. I don't like that. That's fine. That's fine. We, the church, we're the solution. The body of Christ, we're the solution. The body of Christ. We're the solution. Jesus says, in me there is light, no darkness at all. So when they look at the church, they should see that's the way love looks. That's the way hope looks. That's the way joy looks. That's the way unity looks in the church. This, as a matter of fact, I'll challenge all of you. I only have one more verse, and I'm doing good on time. This, when you do your own Bible study, go back and look at the Old Testament. You know what you'll find? Every time the king wanted to do anything, he called the man of God. The man of God never called the king. The king always called the man of God. I'll do it again. Some of you are letting that sink in real good. The church never called the king. The king always called the church. Let me bring it to 2020. Elected officials should be calling us. We shouldn't be calling them. They're not the solution to this problem. The church is. The glorious church. The blood-bought church. The church he died for. I want to hear from the mayor. I'm not calling the mayor. Mayor needs to call us and say, hey, I was noticing that you have a church that loves each other and cares for each other and gets along with each other, and y'all ain't got no drama. How'd you do it? Maybe we can do that in the city. But if the church is not the visible representation of Christ on earth, if the church is just as divided as the world, if the church is just as segmented as the world, then the church will never be what he died for. Do you know, right when Jesus is getting ready to go, in Acts 2 it says, they were all together with one accord that's when the spirit showed up the enabler of power look at this last verse I'm done for God made who never sinned to be the offering for our sin, our misunderstandings, our brokenness, so that we could be made right with God through Christ. I've been a broken record. You've been a broken record you've been a broken record thank you Lord he didn't throw me away thank you Lord that he didn't say you're no longer usable thank you Lord that he loved me enough to say here come back to God and so whatever brokenness we see in this world whatever brokenness we see on TV and whatever brokenness we read about in the news if we can just give them Jesus we can be reconciled if we can just say Jesus is the hope he's the answer he's the the way the truth and the life if we can do that your scratches can be removed you'll stop skipping this time next year we could be talking about something completely different we won't have to keep rehearsing. The reason we keep rehearsing the same problem is because broken records need to be restored. Dignity and love and truth. Who does that? We do. I want everybody, as I begin to pray for you, think about somebody you know that you could help come to the place of God. Now listen to what I'm about to say because I don't want you to want people to come to God who simply disagree with you. I want people to come to God who simply disagree with you. I want you to ask yourself, do I know people who need to come to God who might even be my family members, but they don't see people who don't look like us the same? What can we do? I'll tell you what we can do. I know a man. His name is Jesus. He can fix it all. Do you guys believe that? It was the Lord who put he and I together. This morning I found out his wife had a conversation with one of my elders like three years ago on a plane I didn't know him he didn't know me his wife happened to be sitting next to one of my elders on a plane and he said hey I go to this church named marketplace three plus years later Here I am all things work together for good God is already setting some things up and some of the things we don't understand God is using like this morning where you see this crazy guy in this clergy collar telling you, reconcile to God. Let me pray for you. Father, in the name of Jesus, I thank you and honor you and give you praise. Lord, we have broken records in this room. We have broken records in our families. We have broken records in our families. We have broken records on our jobs. We have broken records that are co-workers. God, we have skipping records. We have stuck records. We have records who are afraid to be repurposed, but you are the reconciler. And you've given us the ministry of reconciliation. You are the only one that can put these records together again. So, give us the strength to do the work, to not point the finger, to not make it somebody else's fault, but to be Christian. In Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you. Thank you."}]}

We are part of God's mighty multiplication movement, planning churches locally and globally. Why? Because there's still so many people and unreached people groups who have yet to hear the good news of Jesus. Every year, my family has prayed and given to the Be More offering because we know that there are billions of people across the globe who have never experienced God's goodness or even heard of the name of Jesus. Right now our lives are crazy busy with kids and work schedules but this is one way for us to be a part of something so much bigger than us, a way to share his name and love across the world. In 2022, Fearless Church planted for Dayton. Because of your generosity, we've been able to focus all of our efforts on building a movement of missionaries who love their neighbors and make disciples with no financial uncertainties. We believe the seeds we've sown are going to change people's lives and bring those who are far from God near to them. And it's all because of you. We can't thank you enough. Hey, Fearless Church, you are making a difference through your partnership with India Gospel League. You are making it possible for a church to be planted in every village of India through the Adopt-a-Region Project. Over the next five years, you're going to make it possible to plant 360 churches in unreached villages. Thank you for what you're doing. So what can you do? I'd encourage you to pray and ask God what he would have you're doing. So what can you do? I'd encourage you to pray and ask God what he would have you to do. If you're led to give financially, you can go to befearless.org and click on give. Last year, over $60,000 was raised and every dollar went to multiplying movements. God might even lead you to be part of a future church plant going out from Fearless. Either way, I'm excited to see what God is going to do. Let's be more together. Every year at this time, we collect a strategic offering known as the Be More Offering. And every dollar given to this offering goes towards one of two initiatives towards starting churches both here in the greater dayton area and across our country and across the world as well as engaging unreached people groups these are groups of people that have never ever heard the good news of the gospel and today they have little to no access there's nobody in their village nobody in their city that knows jesus christ as their lord and savior and couldn't share with them the story of jesus and and i want you to know 100 whatever you and your family gives if you're a guest of ours of course you don't have to give it all but if you're if you're one of the the family members of the fearless family i would encourage you to pray and think about giving whatever you give give is gonna go towards one of these two initiatives. Now, this last September, on September 3rd is actually Labor Day weekend, I shared with you what I believe is our next faith step as a church. As we pursue God's vision to initiate a mighty multiplication movement of God, our next faith step, I really do believe, is to pray, to plan, and prepare to start a new campus or a new church sometime in the fall of 2024. And then what I shared that Sunday is these two important slides. One's a question, one's an answer. I said, will we actually do it? Will we actually start a new campus, a new church in the fall of 2024? And I answered this way, I don't know. You know, I do know this, the apostle Paul says, neither who plants nor he who waters is anything. Only God causes the growth. Our vision is to initiate a mighty multiplication movement of God, not a fearless church. So if it's based on something we can do or we will do, it will fail. But if it's based upon God's power, God's guidance in the process, we cannot fail. god's guidance in the process we cannot fail and so what we can do what we can do is we can be prepared i don't know if we'll start one or not but we can be prepared and the be more offering is part of the way that we are prepared so we're going to take a portion of the be more offering and put it in an account to prepare to be able to start churches. And you say, okay, so what are you gonna use this money for? Because you work hard and you faithfully and sacrificially give. And I thought about three different things that we might use this money for to help start churches. Number one is a place to meet. You can imagine, probably gonna have to rent a place or renovate a place. We'll need equipment, furniture, whatever it might take to be able to pull off kids ministry, student ministry, a Sunday morning experience like this. We're also gonna need people to lead. There'll be multiple volunteers. In fact, Steven mentioned this in the video. Many of you, many of you even watching online might be part of helping go out and start a church. Among those will be team leaders. Some we figure we might have to pay part-time or even full-time, depending on what their role and responsibility is. And of course, we wanna be able to offer programs to whatever community God leads us to start this church. So programs like kids ministry and student ministry for high school and middle school students, college students. We wanna be able to do things like re-engage, parent training, regeneration, divorce care, whatever it might be. And all this costs money. And so we wanna do the best we can to be prepared. So what we've decided to do in our initial conversations, we're continuing as elders even tomorrow morning, is to set aside a good portion of our budget. Right now we're thinking about the number 100,000, maybe more that we set aside and we say, we're gonna put that and that's gonna be used to start churches and engaged unreached people groups. And then we're gonna add whatever the people of Fearless Church give towards the Be More offering. So I really do believe we'll be prepared by next fall with maybe as much as $150,000 reserved to be able to help us find the place, the people and the programs to start a healthy multiplying church in the fall of 2024. Now, here's what I wanna challenge you to do. As you think a healthy, multiplying church in the fall of 2024. Now, here's what I wanna challenge you to do. As you think about this, I wanna challenge you to do two things. One is pray, second is obey. The apostle Paul said it this way, you need to decide in your own heart what God wants you to give. And I would encourage you, what my family's doing right now is we're just praying about it. Like we're not gonna to give in november we're going to pray about it and talk to god see what it is and let me tell you this if the number zero you better give zero okay just pray about it god will direct you there'll be a number it could be ten dollars a hundred and ten dollars a thousand dollars i don't know what it might be but you don't give reluctantly or under pressure so you don't give because some pastor says you want everybody to die and go to hell give money right no that's that's pressure that's not you give based upon your relationship you're like god what what what act of faith would you have me give and then notice it's all about the heart god loves a person who gives cheerfully so then you obey so whatever god lays on your heart you give so i would encourage you to go to be fearless.org whenever that time is and you click on on the button that says Be More, and then you give and trust God to use that money to help start churches and engage unreached people groups. You know, the Be More offering really is all about the movement. Last September, when we said, hey, we believe we're gonna plan and prepare and pray about starting another campus or another church, we started a message series with the goal of studying through the book of Acts the mighty multiplication movement of God. We said, if we believe God has called us to be a multiplying church, not a church that's a lot of people in one location, but it's more like a lot of people in a lot of locations. So we want to send people out from here. If we're going to initiate a mighty multiplication movement of God, then we got to see where it all started. So we looked in the book of Acts, and one of the first things we read was a promise Jesus made to his apostles, to his most committed followers, his disciples. And look what he says. It provides almost an outline, if you will, for the book of Acts. He says, you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And if you go to Acts chapter two, you'll read that story, that the Holy Spirit came down upon these early followers of Jesus Christ and gave them power to do what? To be his witnesses. What does it mean to be a witness of Jesus? It means you're telling people about Jesus everywhere you go. And Jesus says, when the Spirit of God empowers you, this movement's going to start in Jerusalem. And indeed, you can read in Acts chapter 2, verse 2, and all the way through chapter 7, this movement of God, where there were multitudes, thousands, that began to believe and be baptized as believers as the mighty movement of God began. And then Jesus said, it's going to expand, not just in Jerusalem, but it's going to expand out to Judea and Samaria. And Acts acts chapter 8 through chapter 12 tells us the story of now the gentiles people that are not jewish they begin to believe and be baptized and this movement is going to continue to the ends of the earth acts chapter 13 through 28. in fact that's where we're going to be in the month of november looking at various stories and various moments of this part of the movement see jesus Jesus told his most committed, most devoted followers of Jesus Christ, your job is to be my witnesses, to tell people about me everywhere you go. Now, this wasn't just a promise. This wasn't just the command for those first century, first day followers of Jesus. This is a command for anybody. Even if you're just searching and trying to decide if you wanna follow Jesus, if you decide to follow Jesus if you decide to follow Jesus then you become part of his mission to tell people everywhere about Jesus to the ends of the earth now Jesus had promised even before he went and died on the cross he promised his disciples he said look this gospel the good news about Jesus is going to be preached throughout the entire world. In other words, it's gonna go to the ends of the earth so that every nation will hear it. This is the heart of God. God desires that all people would be saved, that all people could be made right with him through a relationship with Jesus. So he says, I wanna go share this message to the world. And so I'm gonna empower my church with the Holy Spirit and commission and send them to go take the gospel to the ends of the earth. And we, as 21st century Americans, we get to be part of the mighty movement to the ends of the earth. Jesus would say to us, look, I've given you my spirit, now be my witnesses to the ends of the earth. It is our turn and our generation to pick up this high calling to initiate and continue the mighty multiplication movement of God now what we begin to look at last week was the beginnings of this guy named Apostle Paul his journeys and you might recognize that name if you've been in church before he was an early church leader an early church missionary and last week we looked at one of his early missionary adventures or journeys and we looked at in acts chapter 13 it began like this so barnabas and saul were sent out by the holy spirit they were sent out from the city of antioch the very first missionaries and it was on this journey that saul began to use his greek name paul so he could better connect with the gentiles whom he was telling about j. And they go out from this place, and then in Acts chapter 15, two chapters later, they're in Jerusalem doing all this stuff, and they come back from Jerusalem, back to the city of Antioch, and then we are told by Luke that Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch. What did they do there? They continued with others to preach the word of the Lord there. They wanted to strengthen the church. So this was the first missionary journey, the conclusion of that missionary adventure for the Indiana Jones of the gospel, the apostle Paul. Now he begins the second missionary adventure, the second missionary journey. In the very next verse, look what it says. It says, at some time, Paul said to Barnabas, let's go back. Let's visit every city we just went to and we preach the word. Let's see how the new believers are doing. He had the heart of a pastor. Paul was a true disciple maker. He wanted to make sure people understood, okay, now you understand who Jesus is. You understand he's the Messiah. Now I want to talk to you more about how to follow him. And so they thought it was a good idea, but then they had a disagreement. Paul and Barnabas couldn't decide, who do we take with us? We take this guy, that guy. In fact, the disagreement became so large that they actually went separate ways. And Barnabas, he ended up taking John Mark, and Paul, he chose Silas. Along the way, he also picks up Timothy, and one other name that you'll recognize, many of you. He picks up a guy by the name of Luke. Now, many of you he picks up a guy by the name of Luke now many of you have heard that name because Luke is actually the author of the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts he picks up Luke and he takes him along with him in the journey and it's actually in Acts chapter 16 that we first see Luke referring to himself being included in these missionary adventures check out these first person pronouns we decided and we sent us to preach. And so who's the we he's talking about? He's talking about Paul, Silas, Timothy, and Luke. These four guys together decided that they're gonna go to Macedonia. They're gonna go to the ends of the earth, right? Beyond Judea, beyond Samaria, beyond Jerusalem. And what are they gonna do? They're gonna to preach the good news. They're going to tell people about Jesus. Now, the reason I share that with you is because as you're reading the book of Acts, it's important you know that when Luke is recording for us some of the things the apostle Paul said and did, this is firsthand knowledge. He either saw it or he heard all about it directly from people like Paul himself or Silas and Timothy. And this is important because in the gospel of Luke, Luke also tells us, look, I have carefully investigated all things. So for some of you, I don't know where you are in your spiritual journey. Some of you might be like me and you say, man, I believe the spirit of God inspired these guys to write down the words in the bible that are exactly what god wants us to hear and that's great there's other these you that are more skeptical and you're like i don't know i mean wasn't this influenced by governments at the time or maybe even even past that time what all these kind of things and i want you to know luke had the heart of an investigative journalist he was going to find out information and he was going to find eyewitness testimony. So when you read the book of Acts, just know you're reading a book that's been carefully investigated by Luke and a book that's supernaturally inspired by the Holy Spirit. So Luke begins to record part of his adventure with the apostle Paul. Check out what he says. He says, we reached this city called Philippi. it's a major city in the district of macedonia and a roman colony and we stayed there several days he goes on he says one sabbath we went away a little way outside the city to a riverbank why would they do that because they thought there would be people there meeting for prayer maybe they heard rumors right and so they sit down and they speak with some of the ladies that were gathering there one of them was a man was a woman by the name of lydia now lydia had great wealth the reason we know that is because of her occupation she dealt in expensive fabrics purple right the color of royalty and so she had great wealth and so she's sitting there and she's listening and i want you to notice this phrase the lord then opened her heart the reason i want to point that out is because you realize when it comes to our relationship with God it is initiated first by God in fact if God doesn't initiate the relationship we won't get to know him Jesus was so bold to say it this way no one can come to me in other words no one puts their faith in Jesus Christ unless the father who sent me draws them to me. God uses his spirit to draw us to his son. In fact, if you would say to me right now, hey, I'm logged online because I heard that Fearless Church is a safe place to ask questions, to express doubts, and that's exactly right. We're glad that you're here. You may say, man, I got more questions than answers. I got more doubts than decisions, right? And you're saying all this kind of stuff, and and answers I got more doubts than decisions right and you're saying all this kind of stuff and I want you to know if for some reason though you're still asking questions and you're still starting to increase in your curiosity what I would say to you what's happening spiritually is the Holy Spirit's drawing you making you inquisitive making you curious doing things in and through your life to pull you towards knowing jesus not just as a first century rabbi but it's the very son of god as your personal lord and savior and so i want you to watch lydia's process she is listening god opens her heart and then she accepts so i guess my question would be for you is do you find yourself in this season of life listening for the voice of God? Not to some guy standing on a stage talking, not to some book that you're reading or podcast you're listening to. Are you really in a position right now where you're saying, man, God, I really do. If you're real, I wanna hear you. Because I would tell you, if you do that, God honors that kind of pursuit by opening your heart and mind, opening you to begin to understand and accept the reality of who Jesus is. For some of you who ride on that line, you'd say, man, more than ever in my life, I'm about to cross over from being someone who's skeptical to believing, man, Jesus, I think he really is the son of God. I think he died on a Roman cross and I think he really is the son of God. I think he died on a Roman cross and I think he rose from the grave. And I think because of who he is and what he's done, I think that can make me right with God. And if you're right there, I just want you to know, keep pressing in because God is drawing you. He's opening your heart. And eventually like Lydia, you might accept the reality. And when she accepted the reality of who Jesus really was and accepted what Paul was teaching her and the other ladies that were there that day, she was baptized. In other words, she made a public pledge of allegiance to Jesus Christ. That's what baptism is. We just saw it a moment ago. It's someone saying, man, I'm Jesus. He is, I'm Jesus's child and he is mine. He is my Lord. He is my savior. He is my master. He is my ruler. I'm committed to follow Jesus. And for those in our household that also believe, they were baptized. So Luke continues on in his journey, and he says this. He says, one day we're going down to that place of prayer. Remember the place of prayer? It was the riverbank. Now, I want to point this out. This is the riverbank where they thought people would be meeting for prayer. And I want to point this out because the place of prayer is less about a place and more about a people. It's more about a people committed to praying and calling out to God. There's power when the people of God gather together. In fact, Jesus would say it this way. He'd say, when two or three followers of Jesus get together, I am there. And you might say, no, wait a second. If Jesus is God and God is everywhere, wouldn't Jesus be everywhere? And he's not saying that he's not everywhere, his presence is everywhere. He said, but when followers of Jesus gather together, they experience the power and the presence of God in a unique way. So when followers of Jesus gather together and they pray that place, wherever it may be, it could be in the parking lot, it could be in a home, it could be in a church, it could be wherever, that becomes the place of prayer, the place of power. And when we come together to pray, there's something supernatural and spiritual that happens. And so we shouldn't be surprised when Paul and Silas and Timothy and Luke are headed to this place of prayer that they encounter a spiritual attack in fact that day they encounter a demon-possessed slave girl and this girl the the demon within her empowered her supernaturally to be able to foretell the future couldn't control the future but could foretell what was going to happen so she starts shouting out and he says she says these men they're the servants of the most high god and they've come to tell you how to be saved she's revealing their identity and their purpose she's revealing what they will do for telling you might read that and say well why is that necessarily a bad thing i mean she's saying something that's true the demon inside of her is acknowledging these are servants of god and these servants have come to tell you how to be saved. Why is that a bad thing? Well, I guess it's not until it goes on day after day after day after day. In fact, the apostle Paul, he began so frustrated, exasperated by what was going on. Clearly, she must have done it for day after day after day. It must have been week after week. Because here's something interesting. From this point on, if you'll look closely, you will not see the name of Timothy or Luke anymore. You won't see those personal first-person pronouns of we and us. So it must have gone on day after day after day after day that eventually Timothy and Luke were like, I'm out. We're going to go do something else. Can you imagine the apostle Paul getting ready to tell people about Jesus, and he starts to talk, and all of a sudden this lady stands up. These are servants of the most high God. They've come to tell you how to be saved. And he's like, thank you, thank you. These are servants of the mighty God. And she keeps interrupting him. And so he gets frustrated. I imagine days, weeks, maybe years later, Luke is talking with Paul and says, dude, that had to be so annoying. He's like, you know it was. So what'd you do? And he said, well, I was so frustrated. I just looked at that demon within her and I said, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And again, put yourself in Luke's shoes. You got to be like, oh dude, this is awesome. Right? Because imagine, like imagine if I told you that story. Man, yesterday there was this lady in Walmart driving me crazy. And I was like, man, you're demon possessed. I said, back up out of the self-checkout line because I got some work to do. Get out of her demon. And y'all would be like, what? Like, did that really happen? And of course, keep in mind, these men are men of great faith. So to Paul, he's like, of course, she responded to the authority of Jesus Christ. And instantly, the demon left her. and this was the problem the masters that were making money off of this ability she had to foretell the future they lost all hopes for wealth so they grabbed Paul and Silas they dragged them before the authorities at the marketplace and they shout out this whole city is an uproar because of these Jews and the city officials had to respond because a huge mob was collecting a people so they made a decision they said okay we're going to punish these guys they're causing problems in our city philippi is not the same anymore so what we're going to do is we're going to beat these guys and we're going to imprison them that's exactly what they did they took polls and they begin to beat them down for proclaiming the good news of jesus for casting out demons, and they throw them in jail. And the jailer took them, he put them in the inner dungeon, in the death row, if you will, and clamped their feet into the stock. And then here's what I want you, don't miss this. Watch how they respond. Beaten within an inch of their life, in a dimly lit dungeon, in the middle of the night, as blood drips from their forehead, maybe seeing the reflection of their broken face in the blood on the ground, these guys start praying and singing hymns to God. You see how they responded to persecution? They responded to persecution through praise we talked about this a couple of weeks ago like if we actually decide not to just talk about it let's pretend we didn't talk about it let's pretend we did it let's pretend we joined the mighty multiplication movement of god and we better be prepared and we better be ready for persecution and pain. The apostle Peter, as he was instructing first century followers of Jesus, remember Peter, the one who denied Jesus and then eventually said, no, no, no, Jesus forgave him and Jesus said, feed my sheep and Peter eventually becomes a critical leader in the first century church. Listen what the apostle Peter wrote. He said this, he said, since Christ suffered physical pain, you must arm yourselves with the same attitude he had don't you risk you could erase parts of the bible and be ready to suffer he goes on he says look it's no shame to suffer for being a christian like if it stops being just cool and cultural and you start to go all in and we start to go to people and places, whether it's across the street or around the world that don't know the good news of Jesus, we should not be surprised if we experience persecution, pain, and suffering. In fact, praise God for the privilege of being connected to the name of Jesus Christ. He continues on. He says, if you suffer in a manner that pleases God, whoa. Stop for a second. Do you see this? If you suffer in a manner that pleases God, I don't know how great you are at grammar. I'd be not very good, but this verse looks like that sometimes my suffering actually pleases God that it's part of his plan I don't know if you've ever thought that before but sometimes God allows you to experience pain and persecution and suffering because he wants to give you a platform that you didn't have before so what do we do we run from it right no he says in those moments you keep on doing what's right you don't back down instead you trust your lives to God who created you, believing that he will never fail you. Here's the reality. Paul and Silas were beaten up, bleeding, suffering, persecuted, and in pain, and they took it as a great honor and privilege to suffer for the sake of Christ. And they believed, they believed regardless of what was going to happen, that they could trust God, that he would never fail them. So in the midst of their suffering, in the midst of their pain, in the midst of the persecution, what did they do? They pray. They sing praises to God. And as they're doing, watch what happens. The other prisoners were listening. You ever notice this? The greater the trial, the louder our testimony. Man, people are watching us. It's so easy to follow Jesus when things are going great man i can come to church lift up my hands work's going good marriage going good kids are obeying me it's crazy things are happening awesome what about your when you're on the door divorce what about when you lose your job what about when you have that pain in your body that won't go away what about when there's death and destruction in your life will you praise him in the pain will we sing in the suffering because if we will that's when we have a platform like never before that's when other people listen other people watch what's happening well that day god decided to rescue them all of a sudden an earthquake shook the entire region, and the jail doors were shaken open. The shackles on their feet and hands were broke open wide, and the jailer wakes up and he says, what in the world's happening? He runs down towards the dungeon, and he looks. He sees the doors open, and he's like, man, they have escaped on my watch. He grabs a sword like any good Roman jailer would have done and prepares to commit suicide because he failed at his task to keep the prisoners in the jail. And there he is about to thrust the sword into his chest. And all of a sudden from depths of the dungeon, he hears, stop, don't do it. We're all here. Nobody's escaped. Nobody's left. He drops the sword. You could hear the clanging on the ground as he runs down to the dungeon. And he falls down before Paul and Silas, and he asks the most important question in the history of the world. He says, what must I do to be saved? Saved from what? Remember, this jailer knew he had beaten and imprisoned, even though the city officials told him to, he had beaten and imprisoned, and it was clear, men of God. He knew he was an unrighteous sinner in need of salvation from God, and then keep in mind the context, right? This was a guy that moments ago was about to end his life and commit suicide. Now just go with me for a moment here. And I hope this is not true for anybody in the room or anybody watching online. But what if today was your last day? Like what if today was the day you died? You know what Holy Scripture says? It says that we are all destined to die. So if you're trying to escape that one, if you're like, man, I'm not, that's not gonna happen to me, like in 110 years from now, I'm still here. No, you're not. You're wrong. But here's the part that makes me nervous, and it should make you nervous, is this other word. That we die, and then we stand before God in judgment. And here is the really bad news. Holy scripture also teaches this, that every one of us is guilty of sin. You understand that. But we all fall short of what? God's glorious standard. Jesus said it this way. You must be holy as your heavenly father is holy. God's standard is perfection. You know, oftentimes we kind of judge and say, man, I wonder what God thinks of me based on one another. And we're like, well, I'm better than her and I'm better than him. Not the worst, not the best, but I am better than most. Right? And Jesus is like, no, no, no, don't compare yourself to one another. Don't even judge one another. That's sin. Judge yourself in comparison to God. And because this Philippian jailer understood that I almost died, I almost committed suicide, I almost stood before God in judgment, and if I would have, I would have fallen short of his standard. Of course he's going to ask, what must I do to be saved? Now watch their answer. They say, in order to be saved, you need to believe in the Lord Jesus. Now many of you have heard that. But then they say this phrase, and. Believe in the Lord Jesus, and what? What do you think it says? I think for many of us, we think it says, and be good. There are many people that believe, and you might be in that position, and that's okay, that believe Jesus died on the cross so that you could be good enough to earn your salvation. That he died so that you could work hard, you could be good enough to earn your salvation. Let me read with you what Scripture says about that. It says, yeah, you're never gonna be made right with God by doing what the law commands. Some of you, you're exhausted. You're doing everything you can to be good enough. You do all this good stuff, and you're trying, and all of a sudden, you read something like this, you're like then what's the purpose of the law like why if it's not to just obey it all so i could be good enough to get to heaven paul says the law simply to show you what a dirt bag you are right the law shows us how sinful you are and how i am. We read the Bible. You ever done this? Try it. Do it every day this week. Try 10 minutes. Just read the Bible. You can pick almost any section, and it won't take you the entire week before you read 10 minutes a day before you read something that you don't do. You'll be like, there you go. I'm failing there. Failing here. Over here. 5, 6, and 7, Jesus preaches this amazing sermon that basically culminates with, yeah, you're all guilty of sin. You've heard it said this way, but I'm going to tack on it so you really understand the heart issue behind that sin. So you might say, okay, okay, so it must be believe in the Lord Jesus and stop sinning. That must be it. And I want to read to you part of the story of the apostle Paul. Paul says, look, I've understood that nothing good dwells in me. That is my sinful nature. How do you know, Paul? How do you know nothing good dwells in you? You're not that bad of a guy. He says, well, here's how I know. I want to do what's right, but I can't. He goes on. He says, I want to do what is good, but I don't. I don't want to do what's wrong, but I end up doing it anyway this life principle in my life that when I want to do what is right, I inevitably do what is wrong. You ever feel that way? I mean, Paul is so frustrated with himself. He says, man, I'm just a miserable person. Some of you, you feel helpless. You feel hopeless. You think, man, I keep trying. And sometimes I have a few good weeks. Some of you, man, you're awesome. You've had a few good years, but then boom, you're back on that website. You're back saying that stuff, doing that stuff, whatever it is. And like the apostle Paul, you feel so defeated. What a miserable person I am. He starts to say, who's gonna free me? This life, these sin cycles, these patterns in my life, they keep coming up dominated by sin and death. And he says, thank God, the answer is Jesus Christ. See, here's the reality. The apostle Paul looked at his own life and his own reality in regards to his salvation. And when someone asked him this question, what must I do to be saved? him this question, what must I do to be saved? His answer was so simple. You believe and you're saved. It's that simple. See, this mighty movement is built on a simple message. The simple message that if we believe in the Lord Jesus, we will be saved. It's not complicated. It's not that we have to add on all this additional religious words and activities. It's believing in the person and the work of Jesus Christ. We experience being rescued from ourselves, rescued from our sin. We experience salvation. And Paul and Silas said to them, look, this is not just for you, it's for future generations. It's for your entire household. so they go and they share the word of the lord with him and all those that live with him and immediately everyone in his house says man we believe we can't believe what an amazing that is it's that simple it's that simple believe in the lord jesus and you'll be saved and they were saved so the jailer takes him back to his house they they they give him a meal clean him up but then they in the morning they took him back to the prison and the city officials they send the police or authorities whatever that may be they send them back to the jail to tell them hey you know what forget it release release paul and silas let him go tell him to get out of here and they show up and the jailer tells paul and silas that and paul says, no, no way. Like they beat us. They imprisoned us without a trial. And we are Roman citizens. No, no, no. You go tell the city officials they need to come to us themselves. They need to apologize to us and release us. Of course, when the city officials hear this, they're freaked out. They're like, oh man, we're going to be in so much trouble with Rome. We can't believe that we did this to Roman citizens. So they go, they apologize. They look at Paul and Silas and say, please, please, just forgive us and leave us, leave the entire city. And so as Paul and Silas, as they left the prison, they went to the home of Lydia. Why? Because there were believers gathered there. And here's the cool thing. the believers gathered there formed the very first church in the city of Philippi and you might recognize the name of that city because years later Paul would write one of his most encouraging letters to them known as the letter of Philippians that we even read to this day God started the Church of Philippi with two people two families committed to one message with lydia and her household and then you have the jailer and his household and they were committed to one message that they believed would change the world and it was this message that if you believe in the lord jesus you will be saved and it was in her home the home of lydia that they initiated the mighty multiplication movement of God to the ends of the earth. From the city of Philippi, going out from there, telling everyone salvation is available to all through faith in Jesus Christ. Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved. Years later, Paul writes to them and he says, look, you've been my partners. You've been part of this mighty movement of god spreading the good news of jesus from the time you first heard it in fact i am certain the god who began the good work in you god who did what we read about today in acts chapter 16 he's going to continue his work all the way to the ends of the earth until it is finished on the day when jesus christ returns we have to understand and we have to remember that this mighty movement that we are part of, that God invites us to join, it's built on a simple message. On a simple message that if you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and he becomes your Lord, your Savior, your treasure, your everything, and you pursue him, that you will be saved. So if this mighty movement of God is built on a simple message, what do we do? I mean, what do we do? When we get up in a few minutes and we walk out these doors, we log off, what do we do? There's two things, two responses that every one of us must do. We have to believe the message and spread the message. So what about for you? What would it look like to believe the message? guess i would ask what's the and for you you're sitting here and and and some of you you you're online you're in this room you're thinking it can't be that simple like you don't know what i've said like you don't know chris my story is i used to follow jesus used to be all committed i used to be in ministry but then i said and did some stuff i I even ran away from God. I didn't believe in God. And now you're telling me, you're telling me that it's that simple to believe in Jesus. What if today, listen to me, what if today, like Lydia, God's opening your heart? It's not that you can save yourself, but what if you're listening and something's going on in your mind and your heart, and he's beginning to open the heart, and what if today you begin to realize there is no and? You believe and you will be saved. Believing not in yourself, not in a church, not in a religious system, believing in the person and the work of Jesus Christ, believing that he's God's son, believing that his death on the cross wasn't because of anything he did. It's because of everything I did and you did and we did. It's because of our sin. But he rose from the grave and anyone who puts their faith in Jesus finds victory over sin and death, not just now, but for all of eternity. What a miserable person I am. What will save me from this life dominated by sin and death? Thank God it's Jesus Christ. It's got to be more complicated. There's got to be more to it. What must I do to be saved? And Paul says, believe. Believe in Jesus and you will be saved. What if, has there ever been a point in your life where you could say, man, that's when I crossed the line. That's when I truly believed. That's when it became not just some sermon at church, that's began real to me, where I put my faith and trust and belief completely in Jesus Christ. And if you have, if you have, and this movement that we're wanting to be a part of, just like in the book of Acts, if this movement is built on a simple message, then we can't just believe it, but we also have to spread the message. If Jesus was to say something to every one of us as followers of Jesus in this room, you know what he would say today? He'd say, you know what? You're my witnesses. Where? Where, Jesus? To the ends of the earth. You know where Dayton, Ohio is? The ends of the earth. That's not a knock against Dayton, by the way. Although sometimes you're, no, I'm just kidding. Dayton's not listed in there, right? Bellbrook's not listed in there. Cincinnati, Columbus, none of that. We were on the heart of God from the very beginning. The ends of the earth works in your office. The ends of the earth lives in your home across the street. I talked to a lady today, born and raised in America, 21 years old, had never ever heard the name Jesus. Living in America, some random dude knocks on her door, like we used to do in the old days, right? Have you ever heard of Jesus? And she's like, nope, never. She said, you know the song, Jesus Loves Me, This I Know? She said, I never heard that until I was 21 years old. So be cautious if you start to think, oh, yeah, that's those people over there in that part of the world, in some country that I can't pronounce. They've never heard of Jesus. the world, in some country that I can't pronounce, they've never heard of Jesus. Be cautious. Be cautious. Because a lot of people, even if they've heard of Jesus, they haven't heard of the gospel. Their version of the gospel is, believe in Jesus and be good enough. Believe in Jesus and stop sinning. But someone, and that someone is you, has to proclaim the good news, believe in Jesus, and you will be saved. See, I'm convinced that he who began a good work in us on March 15, 2020, we started Fearless Church. And I believe God began to do a work among us. And I believe that he will continue his work, work where we become disciples who make disciples. And we truly become a church who starts churches not trying to gather a bunch of people in one location but send out as many people to many places as possible and this is our vision this is our mission this is our movement that god wants us to be part of until it's finished and when will that be when j Jesus returns so y'all if you wake up tomorrow and Jesus is at your front door you're done you did it but until then let's do everything we can to spread this message because this mighty movement is built on a simple message we have to believe it we have to believe it. We have to spread it. 2.5 billion people today, right around 32, 33% of our world's population has heard this wonderful, simple message and believed it. That means over 65% of the world's population, two out of every three people have not yet believed this simple message. And of 5 billion people plus that that makes up, experts tell us that a little over 3 billion, 3 billion people are like that lady I just told you about. They've actually never even heard the name of Jesus. And it's our generation. It's our time to join the movement, to do everything we can to ensure that this gospel goes to the end of the earth, that we take it throughout the world. And that does mean the cubicle down the hall from you, in the cafeteria, the table next to you, on the sports team, down the bench, whatever it may, and it may mean to countries and people and places, no one else wants to go. We have been invited, commissioned, commanded to join the movement to the ends of the earth. Will our generation be found faithful? Could Paul say of us, man, you joined the work from the very beginning, and I'm confident that he who began a good work in you will see it through to the day of completion, to the day of being finished, when Jesus Christ comes back. Let's take this message, let's believe it, and let's share it because this mighty movement is built on a simple message let's pray heavenly father thank you for these words recorded for us by luke we thank you that he was faithful to ask paul a bunch of questions and to carefully write and record this amazing experience that they had but god thank you more than anything more than the the crazy parts of this story. We're thankful for the simple answer you provided for every one of us today, right here in the 21st century, to the question, what must we do to be saved? Believe. Believe in the Lord Jesus and you'll be saved. God, I pray for anybody who heard this morning's message, read these words that is not saved, that today you would draw them closer to you than ever before. And today would be the day that they would believe. And for those of us that believe this message, God, give us a chance this week. In fact, as I'm praying, I challenge you to pray. Ask God, say, God, give me a chance to share this message. Chris, it's so complicated. I don't understand. How about you share this. Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved. What if that's the message, the simple message that we build this movement upon and we're found faithful to share it to the ends of the earth? God, we love you. We thank you for challenging us this morning. It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen."}]}

You see, in January of 2022, I worked in IT as I have my entire adult life since I was a teenager. I actually owned my own IT business, and while I was an elder here at the church, I'd never really taught in a large group setting. I'd definitely never preached before. And yet six months after that, I'd find myself on this stage preaching my first sermon. Six months after that, I was asked if I'd ever consider coming on staff here at the church. Three months after that, I accepted that job and left the kind of known environment of IT that I've always kind of existed in and found myself all of a sudden working in ministry. Now three months later, I'm on stage again preaching another sermon. And so over these past three months, my life has been a little confusing. My life has been a little confusing. Each day as I've decided in my, you know, as I'm going into being 40 years old and deciding to change careers, each day has been a new unknown, a new thing that I wasn't aware of when it comes to working in ministry. So there's been this kind of uncertainty that's always looming every day that I come to work. What new thing am I going to learn today? What new reality of this job that I wasn't aware of before am I going to be educated on today? And so I wasn't sure what my first sermon was going to be. And when they said, you know, when they asked if I'd be willing to open our sermon series on the essentials, I was actually quite relieved because talking about these permanent and unchanging and foundational truths, that's what I love to do. I love telling people, talking about, debating, dialoguing over the things that I believe and why I believe them. One of my favorite things to do is to experience with somebody that moment when the theory behind their faith becomes the reality in their life. I love seeing that. I love seeing people experience truth applied appropriately to themselves and I think there's a reason for that I think we're built with truth as a component of our worship I don't think that actually, I shouldn't say it that way I know that you see at the very beginning of Jesus' ministry there's this conversation that he has with the woman at the well and there's a lot to talk about in regards to that conversation but I specifically want to focus on she asks him this question about how they're going to worship and he responds with there's an hour coming and is now here this is the beginning of his ministry as the coming Messiah this hour is now here when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. And I think there's something about that where spirit is something we're comfortable with this concept of worshiping in spirit. We just finished singing, and singing is an easy and obvious place to raise our voices, to sing praise songs, to worship God with our voices, sing songs, spiritual songs, etc. But there is a component of the worship service. It's not just the singing part. The worship service also includes the sermon because that's where we see God's truth revealed to us. The sermon is the portion of the Sunday morning that is also worshiping in spirit and in truth. And so getting into a series like The Essentials, it's very core to what we're talking about. It's our core beliefs. So there's a question of why do we do a series called Essentials? Why do we come in and out? This is a series, this is the second time we've done this series actually, and we'll continue to do it over the years. Because it's important for us as a church to define who we are. Because the truth brings clarity. And so there's three specific clarities that I want to talk about when it comes to why we do essentials. And those three clarities are exclusion, inclusion, and conversation. So what I mean by that, there's a clarity of exclusion. That clarity defines our core belief document, defines this as being a Christian church. You didn't walk into a Jewish temple or a Mormon church or a Muslim mosque. You've come to a Christian church. Our core belief document is what makes us that. That's our statement of faith. This is what we believe. This is who we are. And so our core belief document defines us as being this and not that. And that's not to say if you come from a background that's any one of those things I just named, it's not as though you're not welcome here. In fact, we welcome you here. We want you to experience what we know to be true from God's revealed word. And so the second type of clarity that this provides is a clarity of inclusion. You see, our statement of faith is something that you'll find on lots of ministry websites. And the reason they have that is because when we're looking at partnering with another ministry or another faith-based organization or another church, one of the things we look for is do they align with what is fundamental about who we are as a church? Likewise, if you're somebody who's searching, for instance, you're looking to find your church home, knowing what a church believes at its core is a really important part of that step because you can look at a church's website from afar, read through their statement of faith, and understand this is a place that I can belong. This is a place that I can be included. They believe what I believe. There's these core beliefs that are these through lines of the faith. And so third, along those same lines, is it provides a clarity of conversation. We talk a lot here on Sunday mornings. We call this our be challenged environment because our purpose here is to challenge you to take that next step of faith. And for many people, that feels like a big step, but the reality is for lots of folks, for myself, a lot of times my next step of faith is a conversation. I've learned something true about God or something true about myself, and now I need to talk about it. I need to unpack it. I need to make it real for myself. And so we have a core belief document. We have a core statement of faith for the purpose of giving clarity. So you can look at and you can say, if you're having a conversation, say, with a co-worker, a relative, a friend, maybe even a family member, well, I know we believe this about the Bible, but I don't remember where it says that thing. Well, you can find it on our core beliefs in our website. So actually, I want to show you. If you go to befearless.org, you click on the about page or on the about section, right there is our core beliefs. It'll bring up a page, and I'd encourage you, if you've never spent any time reading it, take the time to read through it. Understand the reality of our faith and reality of what we believe here and if there's questions about those push in have a conversation email us our emails are on the website as well take the time to understand and make the truth of your faith a reality for who you are so that's why we do series like the essentials now this like Andy mentioned we we're going to be in The Essentials, this Essentials series for the month of July. And what we're talking about these five, four weeks, I can count, these four weeks, are the Trinity is today's message. Next week we're going to talk about God the Father. The week after that we're going to talk about God the Son. And the following week we're going to talk about God the Son. And the following week, we're going to talk about God the Holy Spirit. Now, when you hear that we're going to be talking over these kind of core beliefs or this statement of faith, you can sometimes sense certain people's hesitation. Well, this is all going to be theory. This is all going to be theology and a bunch of doctrine. These words can almost become hindrances. They can become scary words. This feels like an impersonal thing. I'm not a theologian. Why do I care to listen to four straight weeks of theology and doctrine? Well, if that's the hesitation you feel or if that's the impulse that you feel, I'd encourage you to resist that. You see, theology for me first became real as a teenager when I started the process of trying to understand not what is my parents' faith, but what's my faith. And what I found is that that pursuit of knowing who God is, is theology. Sorry, I didn't flip the page. That's the page I meant to be on. Anyhow, theology is that study of God, understanding who God is and why he's revealed himself the way he's revealed himself to us. Doctrine is simply what we teach as a church based off of what we know about God to be true in our study of him, which is the theology. So that's the reason that we go over these things, and that's the reason that I'd encourage you to not simply check out, but to push in if you feel that impulse. So as I mentioned, today we're going to be talking about the Trinity. Now the Trinity is a complex concept. And if you've heard about it, you may recognize it as being a church word. You may not recognize it as being a church word. In fact, for some people, your first impulse when you hear the word Trinity is to think of something that has nothing to do with church. And that's okay. If that's where you're at, that's fine. That's great. We're going to go through this. We're going go through this, we're gonna unpack this. For others, you may recognize this word as being the name of a church. This is Trinity Church in New York City. It's a beautiful church and if you're ever there, you should definitely tour the grounds. But Trinity is more than just simply the name of a church or a word that you'll hear around church, for some people, you may recognize this logo. You may either have it tattooed on yourself or know somebody that has it tattooed on them. It's a real popular tattoo. Or you've just seen it in some sort of Christian art or Christian imagery. This three points with one circle, it kind of alludes to this concept of Trinity, which is three. And so you may have some familiarity that Trinity is about, something about God that has to do with three. For me growing up, this was the symbol on the end of every pew. On the end of every like wooden pew that we had in our church, there was this kind of curled scroll work, and it was this symbol. You'll see it at the top of columns in old cathedrals. You'll see these kind of three-in-one images scattered throughout Christian art and architecture. In fact, there's stained glass that you may stumble upon in certain types of churches and in churches that have these kind of stained glass windows. And you can recognize that there's three symbols here, and you may understand that each one of these symbols represents some component of God or some character of God. Or furthermore, there's these Latin phrases. And you'll see these Latin phrases and they do communicate a truth but it seems like, again, it's a truth that's impartial, it's removed, it's not relevant to me because it's not even the same language that I speak. For others of you, may when i think about when i talk about the trinity you may remember back to sunday school and analogies about the trinity and you may have seen some of these analogies the the three parts of god are like the clover or or the the skin of the apple is god and the flesh is jesus and the seeds of the Spirit. And there's all these analogies that people may have handed you to explain the Trinity. And so you might be comfortable using one of them to talk about it. Others of you may recognize that these are kind of bad analogies. And so you're really hoping that nobody asks you to find the Trinity because you really have no clue why they're bad. You just know that maybe they don't fully communicate it. And I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this. The reason they're bad analogies is because any time we take what's a part of creation and try to use what's inside of creation to define the creator, it's always going to fall short. So this concept of Trinity has a mystery with it. And my hope here is to not get rid of the mystery. My hope is to simply give you something that you can hold on to. Something that you can tangibly grasp about God's character as it's been revealed to us in his triune nature. But I don't want to remove that mystery because that mystery is so crucial to the reality that we are not God. He is something else. And while he has revealed himself to us and he desires relationship with us and that's demonstrated through the Trinity, I don't want to ever remove this concept of awe and wonder and majesty from who God is. So that's my hope today, is that we can communicate some of that. But before we do, let me pray, because I need all the help I can get. Heavenly Father, I just pray that you would speak clearly through me, that I would not be communicating Dave's wisdom or man's wisdom, but simply helping reveal what you've revealed to us. That the truths that we find in your word would be real and active and alive. That people would walk away with something that they can tangibly grasp. That they would understand you and their relationship with their Heavenly Father better at the end of this time than at the beginning. So with that, Lord, I pray that you speak clearly and that you remove all distraction. In your name we pray. Amen. So my goal today is to get through this without using a lot of complex theological vocabulary. And it's not that those theological words aren't helpful, because in fact, the Trinity is one of those theological words. It's actually just an incredibly ancient one. So you may find, as you're looking through your Bible, if you turn to the concordance or if you search through Scripture, you won't find the word Trinity. And for some people, that becomes a bit of a stumbling block. Well, why is this word not there? If we worship a triune God, why is Trinity not in the Bible? Well, the reason it is is because the early church fathers around 200 AD, they see these realities of God's threeness in Scripture clearly revealed, but they don't have a word for it. And so instead of talking each time when they want to talk about God's threeness, instead of building the case every single time, what they do is they decide to create a word. And that's what they often do when it comes to theological concepts, is the word is just a simple help, an easy, simple word to define what can be a very complex concept. And that's what we find in the doctrine of the Trinity. And so what I want to do today, as we walk through this, is simply give you an easy-to-handle definition of what that theological concept of Trinity is. And so first we'll start with our core belief document. This is what you'll find if you go to the website, go to our core beliefs, there's a section in there that's called the Trinity and it has this statement. It says, We believe that there is one God who exists in three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. We believe that the Father and the Son and the Spirit are each God and that the Father and the Son and the Spirit are each God and that the Father and the Son and the Spirit are each a distinct person and then you'll see at the end there's a section of scripture references and each one of our sections in our core belief documents has that area of scripture references and it's there for a purpose it's there because we don't simply want to say listen this is is what man has written, and this is what you should believe. Instead, we want to say, hey, this is the explanation of what we find revealed in Scripture. This is what God has said. This is what God has chosen to reveal about himself. And so anytime you're engaging with something like this, a core belief, a foundational belief, it's always important to be rooted in Scripture. God's revealed truth to us. And so take the time to read those passages. Some of them we're going to touch on today. But what I want to look at is, even though this is a fairly simple, straightforward statement, it's a little bit hard to memorize four, five lines of text. What I want to give you is three simple truths. One, we believe that there is one God. So our first truth, real straightforward, there's one God. The second truth that we find here is who exists in three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and that the Father and the Son and the Spirit are each a distinct person. So we have there is one God. Secondly, God is three persons. Again, there's mystery there. How does that work? Well, it doesn't work inside of our creation, but he's not a part of our creation. He's outside of our creation. So we have one God who exists in three persons. This middle phrase here, the Father and the Son and the Spirit are each God, reveal a third and final truth about this and that is that each person is fully God so there is one God God is three persons and each person is fully God so what is the doctrine of the Trinity? it's that, it's that statement so if my goal was to simply teach you the simple truth of what we believe and a sermon you guys get to go home right now and I'm done but like I said at the beginning my hope is to give you a reason to care about this beyond simply this dot this this statement of our faith. So let me put a little bit of scripture behind what I've just said here, and then we'll move on. So Deuteronomy 6.4 is a real famous passage. It's called the Shema. If you've been in any of our family ministry environments, you've probably heard this because we've built our ministry around that concept of the Shema, which was this Jewish phrase, this Jewish saying that talked about how you teach the next generation about their faith. But it starts with this statement, this listen Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Now the second part of this is that this Old Testament concept, this concept from Deuteronomy, isn't something that's lost when Jesus comes in the New Testament. The New Testament authors weren't disconnecting themselves or divorcing themselves or separating themselves from the Old Testament belief. We see this in Paul's book to Timothy, Paul's letter to Timothy. He says, there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, 1 Timothy 2.5. So we see this concept that there is one God. It's from the very beginning all the way through the New Testament. When Jesus came and the Holy Spirit came and the Acts, this wasn't them introducing two additional gods to the Godhead. There is simply one God. Yet, we find that God is three persons. And so with that, there's this first truth in the fact that God is three persons. The Father is not the Son, the Son or the Spirit. The Son is not the Father or the Spirit. And the Spirit is not the Son, the Son or the Spirit. The Son is not the Father or the Spirit. And the Spirit is not the Father or the Son. It's three statements essentially saying the same thing in three different ways. And we have different scriptures that kind of point at these different areas. And so for the first one, we see Jesus praying. And this is actually introducing how to pray to his disciples. And he starts the prayer with, Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. It And he starts the prayer with, It's called the Lord's Prayer. It's a very famous prayer. You've probably either heard it in church before, or you've seen it in movies, TV, whatever the case may be. But Jesus here is not talking to himself when he prays. In the Garden of Gethsemane, before the cross, when you see Jesus praying, he's not praying to himself. He's praying to God the Father. So God the Father is God. The Son is not the Father or the Spirit. Proved in the same way, but there's different verses. We can actually point to the book of John. Sorry, I'm jumping around a lot, and I'll stop jumping around here in a little bit. John 1.1 starts with a very famous proof of Jesus as being God. It says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Now, what John's doing here with his entire book, like I said, is proving Jesus' divinity, proving that Jesus is God. But just to make sure that there's no confusion as to who he's talking about when he uses language like in the of eating it was the word and the word was with God he then clarifies in verse 14 and he says the word became flesh and dwelt among us and so you could easily substitute Jesus's name for the word word up there in the beginning was Jesus and Jesus was with, and Jesus was with God, and Jesus was God. So God, so the Son is also God. Third, we see the Spirit is not the Father or the Son. And we have this other verse, now finding ourselves in John 14. Here Jesus is talking to his disciples, and this is before he's heading to the cross. This is before his crucifixion. He's preparing them for the fact that he is going to die, raised from the dead, and then ascend into heaven. And he says to them to not worry because the counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things. So we see here Jesus talking about all three persons of the Trinity. The Father is going to send the Spirit in Jesus' name. And so the Spirit is not the Father or the Son. The third part of our statement is that each person is fully God. So we have one God. God exists in three persons. Each person is fully God. So we have one God. God exists in three persons. Each person is fully God. So the Father is God. We see this from Genesis 1-1 all the way through the end of Revelation. God is clearly God. But what I want to focus on specifically is this verse in John 20, verse 17. This is after Jesus' death and resurrection, and he's talking to somebody who's come across him, and he says, go to my brothers, the disciples, and tell them that I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God. So here we clearly see God the Father. Jesus is talking about the Father, and he's calling him God. So God the Father is God. The second truth is that the Son is God. We're going to stay in that same section of John, chapter 20. He's come, and he's talked with his disciples, like he said he was going to go to his brothers and tell them. So now Jesus is talking to, or I'm sorry, we see Jesus after the resurrection interact with his disciples in two different times in the upper room. The first time, there's a disciple missing. And so because he hasn't seen the risen Lord, he's told the other disciples that he's not gonna believe unless he has an opportunity to see the wounds on Jesus, on the risen Lord. And so the second time, all the disciples are gathered. This time, Thomas is there. And suddenly, appearing in the locked room with them is Jesus. Now, Jesus comes straight to Thomas and he says, look at my hands, look at my feet, put your hand in my side, see that I am Jesus, the one that was crucified and is now alive. Thomas' response is really fascinating because his first response, his only response that we see recorded in John is Thomas responded and said, my Lord and my God. And this word here is the same word that they would use for God the Father. This is him calling, Thomas calling Jesus God to his face. Jesus' response to this is not to chide him for calling him wrongly God. His response is to say, you've seen and therefore believed. But blessed are those who've not seen and yet believe. So even in this moment, Jesus is looking forward to people like us who don't get the opportunity to see the risen Lord, but still have this opportunity to believe based on the testimony that is revealed to us in Scripture. And so Thomas' statement here, and Jesus' acknowledgement of that statement, is very clear representation that Jesus is God, the Son is God. Third, we have the Spirit is God. Paul, in writing to the church in Corinth, in 1 Corinthians 3.16, he encourages them and he says, don't you yourselves know that you are God's temple? And for the Jew, what they know about God's temple is that God's temple is the place that God dwells. It's where God resides. And the way that he can say you are God's temple is because the Spirit of God is alive in you. So the place that God dwells is you. And why is that true? Because the Spirit of God is alive in you. So the Spirit, we see, is clearly God. So that is the doctrine of the Trinity and the scriptural support for why we believe in the Trinity, why we believe in a triune God. But all that is, again, is this kind of knowledge. It's just stuff to know. It still leaves you with a question of so what? Well, what does this mean for me? Well, that's the beauty of the Trinity. You see, knowing who God is allows us to have a relationship with him. You wouldn't say you have a relationship with your spouse if you have no clue who they are, what they think, what they believe, what they want, what they desire. So knowing who God is allows us to have a relationship with him. But what we see in the Trinity, what we see in the Trinity is that knowing who God is allows us to have a relationship with him. But what we see in the Trinity, what we see in the Trinity is that knowing who God is shows us his desire to have a relationship with us. So why does the Trinity matter? Why did God send the Son? Why did the Father and the Son send the Spirit? The answers to these questions are the good news of the Christian faith. The Trinity reveals to us the gospel. What we know as created beings is that we have a creator. What we know about this creator is that he's holy, that he's set apart, that he's not us. So knowing that God is holy, that God is set apart, knowing that in his creation he created everything perfect, well what do we find shortly after creation? We find sin entering the picture. And what does sin do? Sin corrupts. Sin does what it always does. It destroys. It eats away. And it tears the relationship between creation and creator. And so if God was just an impartial, set-apart, distant deity, this would have been the end for creation. Wipe the map, start over. But that's not what we see. God in his threeness sends of himself the Son, the Son who is fully God, but didn't consider equality with God something to be held on to, and instead humbled himself and submitting to death, even death on the cross. And what does that death on the cross do for us? That redeems us. So God, who is set apart and is holy, has decided that he still wants to play a part in creation. We can't repair that relationship. He can. See, the reality of our sin is that it has destroyed that relationship. And if we rightly got what we deserved, if we got the death that sin brings with it, it wouldn't pay the penalty enough. We, in our death, still can't repay that penalty. Only Jesus could. Because Jesus, being fully man, is also fully God. So in his selfless sacrifice, we see redemption for us. Undeserved, unmerited, God, who is apart from us, desired to be with us, with us to the point of even providing the repairing relationship. And so in the Trinity, we see that God is holy, the Son redeems, and the Spirit is then sent to secure us. See, the reality of Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection, he did pay that penalty. He did repair the relationship. If he wanted to, he could have ascended to heaven, taken his place rightfully on the throne, and that'd be the end of the story. taken his place rightfully on the throne, and that'd be the end of the story. But it's not the end of the story. He sent his spirit to you, to live inside you, to secure your faith, to encourage your faith. God didn't just simply solve the problem and walk away. He's still here with us. And we see this in Galatians 4, 4 through 7. It says, with us. And we see this in Galatians 4, 4 through 7. It says, when the time came to completion, God sent his son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law so that we might receive adoption as sons. And because we are sons, God sent the spirit of his son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father. So you're no longer a slave, but a son. And if a son, then God has made you an heir. Let me walk through this one more time. You see, the reality here is that God sent his son, didn't need to, again, could have just wiped creation off the map and started again. God's in the heaven. He can do whatever he pleases. And so God didn't just simply erase. He sent his son so that we might receive adoption. And this is a critical part of what that relationship with God does for us. It makes us children together with him. We are part of God's family. So when you see this word as sons, it's just children. That's what it's talking about here. And because we are children, God sent the Spirit. And what does the Spirit give us? It makes it so that we are no longer a slave to our sin. We're no longer a slave to the flesh. We have God's Spirit alive and at work inside of us, which is pushing us towards sanctification. So that we're no longer a slave, instead God has made us heirs. We are part of a royal priesthood. And that's because of God's trinity, his triune nature. Why does the trinity matter? It matters because this is how God loves us. It's how God saves us, and it's how God comforts us. Why did this matter? I'm sorry. It matters because this is who God is and how he loves us. My hope in this message, again, is that you can take comfort in the reality that you don't serve and worship a distant, disconnected, impartial God. My hope is that you can see the beauty of a triune God who can be holy and set apart and yet live among us and then send himself to dwell with us. So what I'd like to do is I'd like to close today with what's called a benediction. It's just a blessing. You see this scattered throughout scripture. Specifically, there's one called the Trinitarian benediction. It's found at the end. Specifically there's one called the Trinitarian Benediction. It's found at the end of Paul's second letter to the church in Corinth. And it says, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Let me pray. Lord, I thank you for the beauty of who you are as you revealed in your scripture. I thank you for being a God who is not just simply sitting, isolated, disconnected, and apart from us, but a God who desires a relationship with us. Thank you for being present in our every day, in our every moment. Thank you for sending your son to sacrificially die on the cross, a sinner's death, undeserved, unjustly. But you willfully submitted to that because you knew that you had the ability to be a perfect sacrifice. And so, Lord, we thank you. We thank you for the beauty of your grace, the reality of your triune nature. And I just pray that as people go from here, they're able to hold on to the reality that they have a God who loves them immensely, who cares for them, and who's there. In your name we pray. Amen. Amen."}]}

Great job. Thankful for all our team of volunteers that put everything on. How about the volunteers that got here early and had coffee ready for us? Oh yeah, give them a round of applause. So good morning and welcome to Fearless Church and Merry Christmas. Now let me hear all the kids in the room. Merry Christmas. Awesome. We're so glad to have all you kids in the room. Moms, dads, grandparents, don't worry. We realize over the next hour and a half while I'm talking, your kids may move around. Don't worry. It won't be that long. But as they're moving around, if you need to walk out of the room, that's right. That's fine. If you need to stay in the room and we'll just kind of manage that, that'll be awesome. So if you're a guest of ours, throughout the month of December, we've been in a series of messages that we have entitled Christmas Carols. And the idea behind this series is to look at some of the most beloved Christmas carols that we sing this time of year and look at the deeper meaning behind the lyrics that have been written for us. Some of them have been written and we have sung for literally hundreds of years. And so this morning, what I want to do is take just a few moments to look at probably one of the most beloved Christmas carols that sang on Christmas Eve all over the world. And that's the Christmas carol, Silent Night. As I was looking at some history on this particular carol, it was written in 1816 by a priest who lived in Austria, and his name was Joseph Moore. And Joseph wrote the lyrics to this. He actually wrote six verses to it, wrote the lyrics to it, and two years later, in the year 1818, at St. Nicholas' Church, he sang this song along with the choir director, this guy named Franz Gruber, and they put together this melody and sang it for the very first time. Well, while they were singing it, there was a guy in the audience who was an organ repairman and even an organ builder, and he listened to it, loved it so much that he asked for the lyrics, he asked for the actual music and melody, went back to his village and shared that with two families that were actually folk singers that would travel. And so all over northern Europe, people begin to hear this carol by these folk singing families that went here and there all over northern Europe. And then finally in the year 1839, this song was sung by one of those families, the Rainer family, just outside the famous church, the Trinity Church in New York City. And so it came to America. Over the years, there's been different arrangements. It's been translated in over 300 different languages. Even at one point in World War I, there was a cease battle moment on Christmas Eve, and this was one of the songs the soldiers sang late in night when they had ceased the war, even for just one night. So you can imagine, in French and German and English, all sing this song together. Now, when we sing it in the English version, we usually only sing three of the six verses that were originally written back in 1816. So what I want to do is I want to look at those three verses just for a few moments, and then we're actually going to do what you would imagine. We're going to light candles, and we're going to sing this song together, as many of you have done for a long time. So this song actually conjures up for us oftentimes a memory or a visual of the nativity scene. And so we imagine the words of Luke. Luke is one of the gospel writers, and Luke did a lot of research to figure out who Jesus is and what he said and did, including his birth. And Luke actually records these words, which many of you have heard before. Mary gave birth to her first child, which was a son. She wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end. Now in this moment, what I usually do is I picture this moment where Mary has the child Jesus wrapped up and she's pondering and thinking about who this child is. And that's where the song begins for us. Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright. If you're a follower of Jesus, you recognize anytime a child is born, it is a miracle of God. It's an amazing thing. In fact, many of you have prayed, some heartache even, prayed for years that you might become pregnant, or your wife might become pregnant, or whatever that might be. And if it happens, you're so excited. And then the birth of a child, we celebrate. That's a miracle. It's wonderful. It's great. But followers of Jesus recognize this isn't just a normal miracle. This is a holy night, a holy moment. See, 750 years before Jesus was born, there was a man by the name of Isaiah. Isaiah was a prophet of God. In other words, the spirit of God was within him. And when Isaiah spoke, everyone listened intently because they believed, man, he is speaking on behalf of God. The words he speaks are the words God wants us to hear. And he prophesied about this moment over 750 years before it happened. He said this, he said, the Lord himself is going to give you a sign. You'll know what God's doing. What's that sign? He says, the virgin will conceive a child. She will give birth to a son and he will be called Emmanuel, which means God with us. This is not some just normal, everyday God miracle of a baby boy being born. This is a holy moment. This is Emmanuel, God loving us so much that he comes down and takes on flesh and is one of us, God with us. And the lyrics of the song continue and remind us that this child was born of a virgin, round yon virgin mother and child. Nine months, obviously, before Jesus was born, Mary finds herself in her hometown of Nazareth, a village, maybe four or five hundred people, and all of a sudden an angel appears to her. The angel Gabriel, and he tells her exactly what's going to happen. You're going to conceive, and you're going to give birth to a child, and all of a sudden, an angel appears to her. The angel Gabriel, and he tells her exactly what's going to happen. You're going to conceive, and you're going to give birth to a child, and he will be the son of the Most High. She says, what? How is this even possible? Like, I'm not married, I've never been with a man, I'm a virgin, and then he begins to describe me. He says, look, it's going to be a work of God. The Holy Spirit's going to come upon you. The power of the Most High will overshadow you, which again, doesn't answer a very specific how this is all going to happen. Oftentimes, that's how God works with us. He gives you exactly what's going to happen, but maybe not all the details that you might want. But he says, here's the important part. The baby to be born is going to be what? Holy, set apart, separate, unique, different than any child in the history of the world, and he will be called what? The Son of God. Again, the lyrics remind us that this child is a holy infant set apart, none like him ever in the history world, past, present, or future. In fact, the prophet Isaiah would describe this child in a rather famous passage of scripture many of you have heard this time of year. For a child is born to us born to us again keep in mind this is over 750 years before the birth of jesus a son is given to us the government will be on his shoulders he will be called and known to us as a wonderful counselor it's a mighty god his everlasting father and prince of peace the prince of peace is given to us so that we can experience the peace of God in our lives. So like the song says, we too might have hope to sleep in heavenly peace. You know, Jesus Christ came on this earth to give you a peace, to give you a rest that you cannot imagine. In fact, as an adult, he's often quoted as saying this, come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. I don't know how the last few weeks, months, or maybe even 2023 has been for you and your family. Maybe things have been great. Maybe this is the year you got married. Maybe this is the year you had your first child, bought a home, whatever it might be. But for others, it's been tough. It's been some really hard things. And you may be even sitting here or watching online and saying, I don't know. I feel this heavy burden and I would love the idea of rest, but I'm not sure. And Jesus says, no, no, I came so that you can have a peace that passes all understanding. The prince of peace wants to bring you and I rest, hope, and peace. And he says, take my yoke upon you. In other words, link yourself to me, connect yourself to me, and let me teach you. I'm humble and I'm gentle at heart. You'll find rest for your souls. Again, following Jesus is not easy. If somebody tells you that following Jesus is easy and everything in your life will be great, that person's lying to you. Slap them in the face. No, I'm just kidding. Don't do that. But they will have to forgive you. It's really weird. We'll talk about that a different week. But no, no. Look, it's not easy. Followers of Jesus, they experience loss of job, pain, suffering, experience all the things, the devastating things we see all over the world. But the difference is their peace is not based on external circumstances or situations. Followers of Jesus have a peace that passes all understanding based on the internal presence of God. It's not just that God helps me avoid hard situations and circumstances. No, he walks with me. hard situations and circumstances. No, he walks with me, Emmanuel, God with us. And so as we come to the second verse in the song, it begins like this. Silent night, holy night, shepherds quake at the sight. I don't know what your church background is, but some of you know, you're like, okay, I know what's happening. You're in your mind picturing the shepherd's field when all of a sudden the angel appeared to these shepherds standing out in the field as they're watching their flocks in fact luke records it this way he says that night there were shepherds staying in the fields nearby they were guarding their sheeps and then here it happens an angel of the lord appeared among them the radiance of the lord's glory surrounded them and how how do you think they responded? Just like you and I would. They were terrified. And Joseph Moore, as he writes these lyrics hundreds of years ago, he captures that. He says, the shepherds were quaking at the sight. Glorious streams from heaven afar. This angel came with a life-changing, world-changing message that Christ the Savior is born. He's borrowing and grabbing the words from the Gospel of Luke. As Luke tells us, yes, the shepherds, of course, were scared to death, but the angel reassured them and said, don't be afraid. Today, I'm gonna bring you news that will forever change your life. Good news, the best news. And this news is good for all people. Doesn't matter if you're Jew or Gentile, doesn't matter what you ever know. This is great news. Today in the city of David is a savior, savior born for you, who is Christ the Lord. Well, as this angel shares with them, he continues to talk and describe to them what they will see. He says, look, you're gonna recognize him by this sign. You'll know the Messiah has come, who the anointed one is, who the Christ is by this. You're going to find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth. He's going to be lying in the manger. So of course, these shepherds were excited, excited to see the promised Messiah whom they had hoped for, whom their parents had hoped for, their grandparents, generations before them had hoped that the Messiah would come. The same Messiah that Isaiah, 750 years before, had prophesied and promised as a spokesman of God. And so they hurried to the village and they found Mary and Joseph, and there was the baby lying in the manger. Again, the song conjures up this memory of this nativity moment. What must they have thought? They show up just like the angel declared. And here's this child wrapped in these soft clothing, lying in a manger, kept in a place that normally the sacrificial lambs would be kept. And they're seeing this. And we enter into the third verse that we often sing. And in fact, we're gonna sing in a few moments. It goes on and it says, silent night, holy night, Son of God loves pure light. Who are these shepherds looking at? What were they looking at? What does love look like? You know, love's one of those abstract ideas, like you, many of you have experienced romantic love, boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife, whatever. Or maybe a parental love or a brotherly love or love among friends, whatever that might be. But it's hard to describe, it's hard to articulate. But God desires that we would know, understand and experience true love. In fact, one of Jesus's followers, his name was John. He's a famous apostle. You've probably heard him in church, the apostle John, right? Years after the resurrection, John is trying to help people like me and you follow Jesus. And he describes to us, he says, you need to understand that God, God is the embodiment of love. God is love. And he shows or demonstrates how much he loves us by how? Sending his only son into the world. What an amazing picture. What an amazing example of an unfailing love because this love did something that we desperately needed. A love so that we might have eternal life through him, through this child. He goes on and he says, look, this is real love. You wanna know what love looks like? It's not that we love God. In fact, in other places of scripture, it actually talks about the idea that you and I, we're not born naturally running towards God, naturally pursuing him, naturally loving him. Instead, we are responding to his love that is initiated by him. And he said, God loves us first. How do we know this? He said, because he sent his son. So right now, you may be watching online. You may be in the stream and you may think, all right, man, God doesn't love me. And you may have a file versus information in your own heart and mind why God wouldn't love you. You may say, well, I don't love me. Why would God love me? But I would tell you, I would tell you, Scripture would tell you, God loves you so much that He showed you by sending you His Son. He sent His Son not to just be born and wrapped in soft clothing and laid in a manger, but He sent His Son to do what? To be a sacrifice, to take away our sins. See, here's the reality. our sins. See, here's the reality. The Bible actually teaches that all of us disobey God, and that disobedience is called sin. And then the Bible starts to tell some things that I don't really like, but over and over in many different ways, it's said this way, that because of my sin, it separates me from God right now and actually for all of eternity. Because of my sin, I'm born separated from God. Because of your sin, you're born separated from God. And because of our sin, we will remain in that state for all of eternity. In other words, when we die, we'll be eternally separated from God in hell, which is horrible, horrific news, so much so that some churches don't even want to think about it or talk about it. But over and over again, we see this in the Bible, and here's the worst part of it all. There's nothing we can do about it. We can go to church. We can even try to be good enough and avoid enough bad stuff, but nothing can make us right with God. But God still loves us. And here's the weird part. He still wants us. He looks at my dirty, dingy life, the things that I think, say, done, past, present, even my future sin, and he says, I still want you to be my child. But because our God is a just God, he punishes all sin. You ever notice how we always want justice when something happens in our world that's wrong? When something happens to someone else, or especially to our own selves, we want justice. If we end up going to court with somebody who has actually broken a law and actually hurt a family member, we want a good judge to enact justice. You know why that is? Because we're made in the image of God. Because we reflect his image, we want justice because our God is a just God. So here's the truth. A just God always, always punishes sin. Either we receive that punishment or someone else does. And that's the beautiful story of Jesus. Jesus came not just to be a little baby in a manger. He came to live a sinless, perfect life. And he came. And when he hung on the cross, he didn't die on the cross for his mistakes, for his disobedience, for his sin. He died on the cross for my sin and your sin. He took it away. He became that sacrifice to take away our sins so that anyone, it doesn't matter who you are, where you've been, what you've done, anyone who puts their faith in Jesus could have a relationship with God and their sin forever removed. Their sin's still punished. How's their sin punished? By Jesus. He took the punishment of that sin. He took that punishment on the cross. So as we think about the lyrics in the third verse of Silent Night, we're reminded of God's love. Love's pure light, but we're also reminded of God's work. Check this out. Jesus is the dawn of redeeming grace. He's the dawn. He's the beginning of God's work. Check this out. Jesus is the dawn of redeeming grace. He's the dawn. He's the beginning of God's redemptive work. Now, what does redeeming grace even mean? Well, grace means unearned, unmerited, undeserved favor. In other words, God knows everything about us. I don't know if that freaks you out. It freaks me out, right? He knows all the things we've ever thought, said, and done that's sinful. All of it. Even the future sin, like I said before. But yet, he still chooses us. He gives us his favor. That's grace. That grace is free to us, but it cost God his only son. It had to be paid for. It had to be redeemed. Webster's dictionary defines redeeming as to buy back or to free from captivity by the payment of ransom. Our redemption, our salvation is made possible by the blood of Jesus, by his sacrifice. And the birth of Jesus is the beginning of that story, the dawn of redeeming grace. And anyone, anyone can experience God's saving grace, God's redeeming grace by choosing to make a commitment to have Jesus Christ be not only their Redeemer, but their ruler. Not only their Savior, but their Lord. And as we sing the last part of that song, we say, Jesus, Lord at thy birth. Jesus, Lord at thy birth. He didn't become Lord at his birth. He's always been Lord because he is eternal. But this is the recognition in the song to say it wasn't that he became Lord when he went to the cross or when he became an adult. It's that he is Lord from the very beginning, the dawn of his redeeming grace. He is the Lord of the world. And my question isn't whether or not you think he's the Lord of the world. I guess my question for me and even you, is he the Lord of your world? I mean, who runs your life, really, honestly? Is it one of those things that you're seeking God and wanting him to lead you and guide you and be your redeemer and your ruler? Or do you run the show? You know, one of the early followers of Jesus, famous guy, his name was Paul. You probably recognize, Apostle Paul, right? Wrote 13 of the 27 historical documents that we call the New Testament. Paul tried to help people follow Jesus. And this is what he said about Jesus as Lord. He said that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, Lord of your life, ruler of your life, master of your life, king of your life, the one running the show. And he says, and you believe in your heart, not only that he died on the cross, but that God actually raised him up from the grave, what not only that he died on the cross, but that God actually raised him up from the grave, what's going to happen to you? You will be saved. You will be redeemed. You will experience the redeeming grace of God. So I want to challenge you. As you process, like you're going to have time. Some of you have got, you're getting in your car. I've talked to a few people getting in a plane in the next couple of days. You're going to have some travel time. You're going to have some downtime when the kids finally fall asleep, covered up with wrapping paper and presents tomorrow or whatever it is, right? You're going to have these moments. And I just want you to capture a few of those moments these next few days and ask yourself, not anybody else, ask yourself, is Jesus my Lord? Is he my Lord? Do I want him just as savior, redeemer, or do I want him as ruler? When Jesus invites us to follow him, he invites us to experience him as the one who rescues us, but also the one who rules our lives. And the apostle Paul would say, you want to, you want to be saved, you want to be redeemed, you make Jesus the Lord of your life. Well, then the shepherds, they see Jesus, they experience this love's pure light, this dawn of redeeming grace, and they tell everyone, this is what happened. Out in the field, this angel came to us and said, Christ, the Savior is born. This is the Savior of the world has been born. And everybody that heard him, they were astonished. But Mary, Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. Whenever I read this passage of Scripture or I think about even this song, Silent Night, I always picture Mary looking at baby Jesus. I mean, clearly she didn't know everything he would become and all that he would do. I mean, she's holding her savior in her arms. And I start to think, I wonder what she thought, what she pondered, what she treasured up in her heart. And in my mind, I wonder how much it does really kind of align with the words that that young priest wrote over 200 years ago. Does she think things like, man, this night is completely holy, it's separated. There's this moment in history, in all the world that is being changed. She recognizes, I know my story. I know this child. You know, you might doubt, you might doubt. So there's people in this room. There's people online that are like, man, I doubt the virgin birth. There is one person that never, never one time doubted it, and it was her. Mary didn't doubt. She knew without a doubt. And she experienced that night as she watched the God of this world sleep. How could he sleep with all that's going on? And she hears the stories of the shepherds that say, man, an angel came and appeared to us, and this baby, she had heard it before, but now to hear some complete strangers come in and say, this is Christ. He's our Savior. He's born Christ. The Savior is born. He loves pure light. He's the Son of God. He's the dawn of redeeming grace. This is Jesus. This is Jesus, Lord, at thy birth. It's this particular verse, the third verse, that we do something that almost every church in our area and a lot of churches all over the world will do tonight. We will sing and light candles. And as we light candles, in just a moment, we're gonna light candles and you'll help the person next to you. And before you know it, in a matter of about 60 seconds, the whole room, everyone's holding candlelight. It's a cool moment. And it may bring back memories. I call them temporal memories that are special. They're temporal because they're about this life. You may remember singing this song with your grandmother. You may remember a time with your kids. And those are all wonderful memories. But I want to challenge you this year. When we sing this song in just a few moments, to think about the lyrics, to think about the reality that Jesus is indeed the Son of God. He is love's pure light. He is the embodiment of what it looks like to love, living his life to sacrifice so that we could have eternal life. He is the dawn of redeeming grace. When we get to that part, I just, man, just let it soak in. If you don't wanna sing that part, just listen or read the words. We'll have them on the screen. And you just soak it in, man, that he is the one that redeemed me, offering me this unmerited, undeserved favor, this redeeming grace. He is the Lord, the Lord at thy birth. Jesus said about himself, I'm the light of the world. And as we share this light with one another, as we sing this song, may we be forever reminded that he is indeed, he is indeed our Savior, the dawn of our redeeming grace. Silent night is more than just a carol that we sing. It's more than just a familiar song. Silent night is actually an act of worship, an act of recognition, where we recognize who Jesus is and why he came. He came to redeem us. So we celebrate him as redeemer. Right now, I'm going to ask Caitlin and Nicole, if they'll make their way out here, they're going to lead us in this song. And if you would go ahead and grab your candle, or if you're next to somebody that can't grab their candle, limited mobility, whatever, please help them grab that. And I wanna pray for us. And after I pray, I want us to take time to sing this song along with these ladies who will lead us. And I want you to sing it as an act of worship, not just a memory, not just a fuzzy moment that feels special, but instead worship and recognition saying, God, we see, we see what love's pure light looks like. God, we see and recognize and worship you for the redeeming grace that you bring into our lives. So let me pray for us and we'll begin singing and then we'll pass the light all over the auditorium. Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, we thank you, God, for your love. Indeed, we just read a moment ago that you are love and you show and display your love by giving us your one and only son, Jesus. And so, Lord, we are here to worship and to recognize and sing this very familiar song, but maybe in a new way, in a new way that reminds us of the dawn of redeeming grace. God, we give you this time as an act of worship and recognition. We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen."}]}

We want God to do something in us so we can do something through us, but that doesn't just apply to us as individuals. It applies to us as a church. We want God to be doing something here so that we grow, so that we can send people out to plant more churches. Chris announced this earlier in May, but I have the honor and the privilege to be the first one to be sent out to plant a church. I couldn't be more excited to share the vision that God has been given me as I've prayed over the past year about what we're going to do, how we're going to invest in the lives of our friends, families, and neighbors. I don't want to spoil the vision right now. What I want to do is I want to invite you to come Sunday night, October 3rd, here to Fearless Church to hear all about the vision that God has given me. We'll be providing child care for this event so there are no barriers for you to come. Go to events.befearless.org to register your children and to see all the specific event times and information. Everybody knows somebody that doesn't know Jesus. So I want to challenge you to prayerfully consider coming to hear about how we're going to take the hope of Jesus straight to their doorstep. Good morning and welcome to Fearless Church. We're glad you're here. If you're a guest of ours, I want to start real quick by sharing with you our vision. The TV is off. Okay, hang on just a second. So our vision is to have a TV that is, there it goes, there we go. Hey, everybody cheer. That makes me feel better in my insecurity here. Our vision is really answering the question of where do we as a church believe God is leading us. And for some of you that have been around, you already know this. Or if you're new around here, it's important that no matter what church you're a part of, you say, okay, well, where's God lead? What's God leading them to do? What's the unique vision that God's called them to accomplish? In ours, we say it this way. We believe God has called us to initiate a mighty multiplication movement of God. Not that we'd simply be one church or one prayer, but we would multiply where we truly become disciples. That's a word that Jesus uses for somebody that follows him, that thinks, acts, and believes, and is devoted to him, that actually goes out and helps other people think, act, and become like Christ. To be a disciple that makes disciples, working together to be a church who starts churches both locally and globally. We're not satisfied with being one church in one location. We believe God has called Fearless Church to initiate a movement, a disciple making, a church planting movement all over the world. And we don't exactly know how to do that. We're trying to faithfully learn where individually we each become people. Like, I don't know if you're sitting there right now and you think, man, yeah, I'm a disciple. I'm a follower of Jesus. Who knows how to help other people follow Jesus? If you're not there yet, that's okay. Just hang around. We're trying to help us learn together. How do we become disciples? We make disciples. And then we work together. And as groups and as teams, we actually leave this place and we become a church that starts churches. And so our goal, our next step that we believe God has for us is one of our goals is this, to start our first multiplying church in 2022. Next year, we believe God as we pray, as we think about this, as we try to be wise stewards of everything, we believe God wants us to send a team out. So you might ask this question, well then, who is on that team? Well, we know Pastor Chris Volz and his lovely bride, Grace, and their kids are part of that team. There's a few individuals that have said, you know what? We know we're not supposed to stay here. We're supposed to go with them. But there's many more that we don't know about. And I'm looking at some of them and I'm going to begin to point you out and ask you to leave. No, I'm just kidding. You're like, oh my goodness, what a great first Sunday. You get out of here. No, we don't know. But here's what I want to ask you to do, even if it's your first time. And I know this is extremely weird, but what if God has something for you? Something that he wants to do in and through your life way more than you've ever thought. You say, well, I'm no, I'm not the one. Here's what I just want to ask you to do. It's three things. First thing is like Chris said in that video, I want to challenge you to attend that informational meeting. It's October 3rd, 4 p.m. Probably be in this room. We're 90% sure it'll be in this room because I believe it's not going to be dozens. I think hundreds of people are going to come to this and I want you to be a part of it. In fact, you can go to that site he mentioned, events.befearless.org. You can go there right now. It's not rude to get on keep you a long time. We want to share with you the next steps we believe God is leading us to do. And after you attend that event, or even before, I want to ask you to pray. I don't know if you're a praying person or not, if you ever pray. You just ask God. If you're a follower of Jesus, this should be part of your regular diet as a follower of Jesus, is talking to God. And so you pray and say, God, man, God, what do you want? Do you want me to stay here? Am I supposed to be here for a season? Or God, is this a time that I'm supposed to go? And I want all of us to pray. I've told this to our church staff, to our elders. I'm telling it even to pray. God, and then the final thing, and this is the most important, to obey. Whatever God tells you to do, that you'd say, you know, okay, God, I'm coming in here blank slate. I mean, this is my first time in this church, so it sounds like in four weeks from now, I'm going to this meeting, and I'm gonna attend this thing, and God, I'm gonna pray. And God, could you have me be part of starting another church? Starting a church to help reach people that things differently meets at different times different location is different than fearless church but you've called me in this season of life to step out in faith and do that when you think about fearless church i tell people this all the time think of us as a river not a lake a lake church is one that says you know what let's get everybody to flow in here more people in one location and we talk a lot about how to add seats how can we get more seats how can we blow out that that wall? How can we do this? That's not us. That's not who God's called us to be as a church. It's not our goal to add seats. Not seat more, but send more is honestly our goal. That we would be a church that people would come in and stay for a few months, for a few years, maybe a few of us. I think I'm in this category, stay for a few decades. But I'm praying just like you but eventually that all of us would get trained up equipped inspired and in great faith say you know what this message the hope of the gospel is not designed to stay here it's not just us four and no more like we go we go and so we celebrate the numbers we look at at the end of the year is how many people we've sent man i've been praying for a while and i cannot wait for the day i don't know the day yet yet, but there will be a day in 2022, I believe with all my heart, in a moment like this where we're all in this room and we will say, okay, those that are part of that team stand up. And I don't know if it's five, I don't know if it's 50, I don't know if it's 150 people, men, women, boys and girls, little babies, all the way up to older men and we will pray and we will send them out as mighty missionaries of God to go to people in places that maybe we can't reach as a church. We have got to initiate this movement to become disciples who make disciples. Working together to be a church who starts churches. The unstoppable movement of God for the glory of God and the salvation of mankind. That is who we are as Fearless Church and I'm excited to see what God's going to do in the days, the months, and the salvation of mankind. That is who we are as Fearless Church. And I'm excited to see what God's gonna do in the days, the months, and the years ahead. I don't know a lot of the answers to a lot of the questions I have of how we're doing it, but we're seeking God's word. We're praying, we're talking to men and women that have done this before us and try to get wisdom. But I am excited to see what God's going to do for his glory. I believe it's infinitely more than all that we can ask or imagine. I'm also very excited that you're here this morning, whether Fearless Church is a place you come all the time or it's your very first time, because today we're kicking off a brand new series of messages. That's how we do things around here. We usually do messages and series anywhere from two weeks to six weeks, and the reason we do that is try to create information that's very bite-sized, very simple, so that we can do our best to leave this place and all of us try to do whatever we learn today. So I'm gonna try to do that and honor God and help you and help myself know, okay, what's one thing we can do this week? What's one thing we can do to apply God's word? And so this message series is entitled fight right it's one word and that's actually what we want everyone to commit to do to say i'm ready to fight which sounds kind of funny in church you know you're typically think of churches passive real nice little timid people but no no we and you see this language throughout the new testament there's a warrior type language we're soldiers for christ and we're going to fight and if you'll notice the subtitle you've probably already looked at it, it's this idea of going toe-to-toe, battling with depression and anxiety. Before we dive in, I want to share with you, every time I think about depression, anxiety, other mental health issues, and the world, the church world, what I think of constantly is the movie Fight Club. And I'm reminded of this scene. Check it out. Gentlemen, welcome to Fight Club. The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club. Second rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club. So when it comes to depression and anxiety in church the first rule about depression and or anxiety is we don't talk about depression or anxiety we can't we're followers of jesus we're supposed to be full of hope right i'm so full hope every day i wake up full of hope full of peace full of joy experiencing joy in this, experiencing joy in this life, expressing joy in this life. Hey, how are you doing, brother? Man, I'm blessed and highly favored. Can't talk about it. What about anxiety? Think about those words that we hold firm and celebrate, words of faith, belief, trust. How could you worry about anything? In fact, the Bible, some of you already know, says do not be anxious about anything. So instead of talking about it, instead of wrestling with it, we pull back. I mean, come on, the guy on stage, I went to seminary and my degree is in theology, not in psychology. This is an issue for out there not in here out there we'll talk about it out there we'll treat it but in here in here we don't talk about it because the first rule of depression and anxiety is we don't talk about depression and anxiety well again if you're new here to fearless church you've been around you'll probably roll your eyes at the next slide because I talk about this a lot. We have a unique value system, a unique culture, a unique identity that we're not ashamed of. It is our way of doing ministry. In fact, we call it the fearless code. It's not the only way to do ministry, it's our way. And part of the fearless code says this, that we don't hide. In fact, we believe firmly that you will never become the man or woman, the boy or girl that God desires for you to be. You'll never do what he desires for you to do if you are committed to hiding and pretending like you've got it all together. I grew up in a church where there were some things that was okay to admit and acknowledge, others, depression and anxiety, no. No, no, no, no, no. You don't talk about that. You don't talk about that. Maybe you talk about people with that, but you don't talk about that, right? You don't talk about that kind of stuff. And our value is, whether it's on this stage, in our community groups, on our serving teams, to be open and honest about our fears, our failures, our weaknesses, to talk about these tough things like depression and anxiety and how we're not just going to sit back and be beat up by those things in our life. We're going to fight back. And that's not one of our only values. Another one is that we say we take new ground. And when we talk about this take new ground, this is this idea that all of us, myself included, we all naturally drift towards what is safe, familiar, comfortable, right? That's how we're wired up. And this pull from the courageous to the complacent actually works against what God wants to do in your life and in my life and through our lives. And the reality is the growth that Jesus wants for you, even if you're not a follower of Jesus yet, the growth he wants for you always lies on the other side of your next faith step you're not gonna grow simply by hearing a guy talk on stage and getting more information in your head you're gonna grow by taking the Word of God and doing it applying it stepping out in faith doing those things and he grows us we get stronger better more capable we become more like Christ. And so here at Fearless Church, we're committed to fight complacency tooth and nail and do whatever it takes to truly become fearless followers of Jesus who change the world. So because we're committed to not hide, we don't always do this perfect, and we're committed to grow and take new ground in our faith, we're not just going to talk about depression and anxiety. Over the next couple weeks, we're going to do our very best to learn how to fight depression and anxiety. As I was kind of preparing for this message, I read a book that it's called Out of the Cave. It's a great book. We'll talk about it here in just a minute, but it was a pastor from Alabama that shares a little bit of his story. And he lists in the beginning, as you would imagine, some statistics that he discovered as he was doing some final research near the end of 2020. And you can imagine that research. But numbers, obviously, over the last 18 months have skyrocketed in light of depression and anxiety. Right now there's argument and statistics depending on what study that one in nine people are on some form of antidepressant or any anxiety type medicine. One in five have been, have been at some point. That's 20% of the US population has been on some kind of, so if you're on an antidepressant or an anxiety, you're like, you're not, don't be embarrassed. Like that's something that's common in our culture, right? And this anxiety and depression, it doesn't recognize and doesn't discriminate. Doesn't matter what age you are, what's your gender, what's your race, what's your income, what's your educational level. As you follow all these statistics and these numbers, there's no, oh, this type of people that live over here, they deal with depression. In fact, you can't follow. It robs people of the pleasure, of the joy, of the contentment, of the peace that God honestly desires for them to have in their lives. And so we, as followers of Jesus, have to figure out, okay, well, how do we fight this thing? And I want to say this very clear. Medication. Let me say this very, very clear. Medication cannot be our only weapon. Medication cannot be our only weapon. In fact, I want to argue, I'm not against medication. In the next couple of weeks, we're going to talk about that. But I want you to know, like, I think we need to take a step back and and be reminded of our souls of our spirit what is the spiritual foundation that should be laid as we fight this thing because however your spiritual life is and your soul health that's going to affect your mental health your emotional health your physical health that's going to affect. Faith is foundational, not supplemental. When it comes to depression and anxiety, faith, think of it as your faith is foundational in this fight, not supplemental. In fact, we've got to remember promises. And I want to show you a promise that maybe is the only reason. If you're dealing with depression, anxiety today, I'm so glad you're here. You can take a picture of this slide or grab me after service. And I'll tell you it's Psalm 34. And it's this one right here. The righteous cry out. In other words, those that are righteous, not because they go to church, not because they're good enough, but because they have faith in Christ. When we have faith in Jesus Christ and who he is and what he's done for you on the cross, then you are righteous. Doesn't mean you're perfectly righteous in the sense of your behavior, but when you stand before God, you are righteous. So that's you. If you're a follower of Jesus Christ, you are righteous. And it says God's people, the righteous cry out. And I love this. What is the promise there? God hears. If you've ever dealt with anxiety or depression, it feels like God's not hearing me, and God rescues them in what? All their troubles. Is anxiety and depression part of that? And then will he rescue us? And then go on, it says, the Lord is near to the brokenhearted, and he saves those who are crushed in spirit. Now, I'm going to be transparent with you. I personally, at this point in my life, I've never dealt with anxiety and depression. But I have a lot of friends and family members that this is real. And these are words that they would use to say, man, when you're dealing with this, you just feel crushed. It's just heavy. It's not because you want to. Nobody wakes up and says, man, my goal today is to be totally anxious. I'd love not to be able to leave my house. I'd love to be depressed all day. That'll make my marriage awesome. My kids will love that, right? Nobody says that, but it creeps up on us. And we're gonna talk in the weeks to come more in depth how that looks. But look at this promise that we have, that God's there to hear us, to rescue. And this is why we've got to go, I'm arguing for this spiritual, this faith foundation from God's word. And I just want to show you a couple of phrases from one of my favorite authors, inspired by the spirit of God, the apostle Paul, wrote a lot of the New Testament, right? 13 of the 27 books that you find in the second half of the Bible, the New Testament, were authored by this guy, empowered by the Spirit. And I just want to read a couple phrases that he says in 2 Corinthians. Check this out. He says this, for although we live in the flesh, so in other words, we talk about things like depression and anxiety, and those are real things. Those are real things that we can experience, emotional health, mental health. There's all kinds of research and things that every year comes out that we're learning more about, all these things that I don't understand, chemicals in the brain, that kind of stuff. He says, although that's a reality, we don't wage war according to the flesh. Our fight's different. Why is it different? He says, because we have weapons of our warfare that are not of the flesh. The foundation of our fight is not of the world. It's a spiritual phenomenon. He goes on and he says they're powerful through uh through god empowered by god for the demolition of strongholds so let's stop at the weapons of warfare when you think about this being a foundational faith issue what are our weapons of warfare and around here we i say this over and over again partly because i just believe it over and over again in my life but i want us to memorize it our weapons are god's word god's spirit and god's people god's word god's spirit and god's people god's word in fact the apostle paul said it this way he said every day put on the full armor of god being ready for the spiritual reality of a battle that's in front of you then he talks about the breastplate of righteousness the helmet of salvation the belt of truth if you grew up in church you might have a little song to remember that but he ends with this he says and finally pick up the sword of the spirit which is the word of god it is our offensive weapon so we have the word of god the truth of god the foundation of god's word then we have god's spirit in fact paul says this way to the church in rome the same spirit that raised christ from the dead a few moments ago i think two different times we sang songs about the resurrection paul says if if if Jesus didn't rise from the grave, our faith is in vain. So the fact that we believe in the resurrection, the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead, which our entire faith hinges upon, lives in us. Now that's a powerful reality. It's not just God with us. It is God living in us. God's word, God's us it is God living in us God's word God's spirit and God's people in fact we're told that we should bear one another's burdens thus fulfill the law of Christ God has put his word in front of you his spirit in you and his people with you to fight this battle but here's the weird thing if you have ever dealt with depression and anxiety, and at some level, all of us have had some of that. Maybe it's a few days, maybe it's a few hours. Some of it's a few decades. Some of it's maybe major, some of it's minor, some of it's a little big, whatever it might be. But if you've ever fought that, one of the natural tendencies, and you already know this, is we step away. We begin to isolate. We pull away from reading God's word. It's already a challenge enough. Those of you that are like me, and maybe you don't have a daily struggle with depression, anxiety, it's already hard enough to get in God's word. There's all kinds of distractions. We're not connecting to God's spirit through prayer and obedience. Like, that's already a challenging thing. And, man, we're too busy to get with God's people, right? And so we withdraw. And what happens is when we withdraw, we are withdrawing from the things God uses to bring truth and love and grace and hope into our lives. Let me tell you something. If you've ever dealt with depression again or anxiety, you know this. Isolation is one of the worst things you can do. But it's one of the things you want to really, really do. When you're not feeling good, you don't show up to church when you're battling with this. Some of you that have been open and honest and thank you for helping me, you've been so transparent to say, man, there are times I show up to this place and it is the last place I want to be, but I know, I know I need to be around God's people. So the last thing I want to do is pray to God that I think has abandoned me, but I know it's critical. I know that is my weapon of warfare. And then watch what it says. It says, these weapons are powerful through God. I like saying it this way. These weapons are empowered by God. God's word is a powerful thing. God's spirit is God. It's the Trinity, the Father, the son of the spirit. It's powerful. God's people, the spirit of God working in and through God's people is a powerful thing. To do what? To demolish, to destroy strongholds. Now this word strongholds, this is the only time it appears in the New Testament, this particular Greek word. It literally means a strong military fortification. Paul continues this military type language, this war language. And these strongholds that he's talking about specifically are strongholds of false arguments or lies. Strongholds, lies that you and I believe that other people have told us, or maybe that we've read, or maybe that we've seen on TV. Lies that we tell ourselves. What are the lies you tell yourself? Lies that our enemy speaks into our lives. The Bible talks about a very real, literal enemy, Satan, the devil, the enemy, the evil one, the accuser. And when Jesus was addressing how this enemy operates, listen to what he says. He said, when he, and he talks about the devil, when he tells a lie, just notice he's speaking from his own nature. Why do we know that's true? Because he's a liar, and he's the father of lies. Oftentimes when I'm in pastoral counseling, I'll go to this text, because the reality is Satan is really good at lying to us. He is not sovereign. In other words, he's not all-knowing, but he's been around a long time. And in fact, he's been around your life a long time. So he knows how to trick us and to deceive us and convince us that whatever stronghold lie he's told us, we'll buy in and we'll believe, and it'll take root in our hearts and our lives. And he's the father of lies, and you can see that in Genesis 3. He's the father of lies, and you can see that in Genesis 3. He's the originator of lies, and he's really, really good at it. And every time we believe one of those lies about God, about other people, about ourselves, it establishes a stronghold in our heart and life. These stronghold lies about yourself, what are they? One of them I see oftentimes is people declare, my illness is my identity. And they'll say simple phrases. I am depressed. I am anxious. You are not depressed. You are not anxious. You are fighting depression. You're fighting anxiety. Quit linking yourself to your diagnosis. You're more than that. You might be fighting it, so fight well. You can eliminate that language right off the bat. What are the other lies you believe about yourself? What about other people? When you're dealing with these things, you think, man, nobody, nobody cares. You show up to your community group, other people got stuff going on, losing jobs, physical illness, marriage, like, and you're listening to the prayer request and you're like, I'm not gonna. Just the same thing. It's been now 10 weeks now and I'm not gonna break. Other people don't care. Other people don't understand. Other people don't understand. Other people can't help. You ever get in that situation? There's no way anybody else can help. Man, I'm hopeless. This battle's going on time and time what about god god's abandoned me god's mad at me he's against me he's not for me what are those stronghold lies and here's the deal listen to this if we can identify those and i believe you can as you pray and you ask god and ask those close to you what are what are some lies what are some things you actually hear me say out loud things you see me do that that tells you i'm buying your lives here's the great part we know how to fight against them we have weapons of warfare and the apostle paul the next phrase watch what he says our goal is to demolish and destroy these lies these false arguments these lies that we adopt from others from ourselves from the enemy the prideful things that rise up against the knowledge of God and his truth. How do we demolish them? How do we fight against them? What does he say? We take captive every thought, every thought. In other words, this is the idea that we're gonna say, you know what? In my thoughts, in my words, in my actions, I'm committed to figure out how to obey Christ. To the church in Rome, Paul said it this way, don't be conformed to this world. This world has an approach. When we address subjects like depression and anxiety and other mental health issues, the world seems to supplement faith and spirituality. Supplement it. It's a thing. Here, we'll give you this diagnosis, we'll give you this pill, and here's some other things you might want to do in supplement including some spiritual life things and again i want you to recognize we don't conform to that way of thinking we actually flip the script as followers of jesus we say wait a second what if what if medication isn't first what if our faith becomes first what if our fate what if we transform the renewal of our mind and we say, you know what, I've got to think differently about this fight. I'm not going to sit on the sideline. I'm not going to be passive. I'm going to step into this fight, but recognize the foundation and the importance of my faith in this fight. It's foundational, not supplemental. In fact, as followers of Jesus, we say, you know what? My commitment is I'm going to take every thought captive. This idea is to gain full control of every thought. It's this idea of bringing our thoughts and our thinking in submission and in line with the truth. And this is not easy. It's a challenging thing, but let me let you, you already know this, but I'm going to say it out loud just so we're all in agreement here. Depression and anxiety, a major component of depression and anxiety is what we think about and how we think about it. What we think, I'm not saying it's exclusive, but a major component of depression and anxiety is what we think about and how we think about it. So how do we do this? How do we take every thought captive? Well, as I shared with you before, I was reading this pastor's story of his own personal battle and victory, not a complete victory, but a lot of victory in his life over some of the depression, anxiety he battled with. And he said it very well. He said, if we're going to take our thoughts captive, he said, simply put, what you do is you don't chew on your thoughts. You choose your thoughts. Don't chew on your thoughts. You choose your thoughts. And he talked about this idea of rumination. And you've probably heard, and he gave this example, and I'll give it as well. A cow is a rumination-type animal, right? And so what that means is a cow, if you, I live out in the country, and so we got a lot of cows around us, and I get to actually see this play out in front of me. They chew the cud, right? And if you've ever been around cattle, you know what that means. If you're not, you're like, what in the world? So they chew the cud, the cow grabs the grass, right? And begins to chew. He swallows it. Mmm, good. And then he vomits it back up in his mouth. And he chews it again, swallows it, vomits it back up, swallows it, vomits it back up. How many times is that what we do with the negative thoughts, feelings, and circumstances in our life? Thinking about it at lunch today, about 2.30 this morning or tomorrow morning, you're alive, yes, I hope you are, wide awake in bed, eyes open, and you're ruminating. You're thinking about this. You're bringing it back up, and oftentimes it tastes a lot different the second time or third time, fourth time around, right? Clinical psychologist and depression expert Stephen Ilarity, excuse me, he said it this way. Rumination appears to be instinctive human response when something goes wrong in our life. appears to be instinctive human response when something goes wrong in our life. It's as if we're hardwired to replay, excuse me, our trials and tribulations over and over again in the mind's eyes. We can all relate to that, right? To mull things over for a while before we're ready to move on. I didn't highlight this part right here, ready to move on, but I can tell you this. Depression and anxiety happens when we cannot break out of that cycle we're constantly mulling and ruminating it over and over and over and over and over in our minds oftentimes in isolation and every time we do that those strongholds grow deeper and deeper and deeper into our hearts and lives and we become convinced they're not lies they're true no one cares about me doesn't matter what anybody says to you are convinced you've got years of ruminating on that i will never ever beat this thing i'll never get better you get these roots deep in you and me we get them in they become strongholds and pauses no fight back Take every thought captive bring it under submission We've got to decide are we gonna chew or choose? Would you say something with me say I choose? No say it like you're in a fight. Say, I choose. I choose. So what do you choose? What do you choose? And this is not an easy thing. Please don't hear me. Please don't hear me saying, oh, this is really easy. I wanted to take his words, because I thought they were memorable, so that we could all week long be like okay am i chewing on this or am i choosing am i chewing chewing on my problems or am i choosing to focus on the promises am i ruminating or am i meditating jesus said in this life you will have many trials and sorrows here's the reality i know you probably hoped fearless church would be a feel-good church. We're just not really good at that. But here's the reality is, here's the deal. You are going to have problems. In fact, I don't even know why you didn't say amen at that, right? You should be like, amen. And I don't even know why people do that in church, right? Amen, right? So be it. That's right. You're going to have many trials, many sorrows. You will have problems. And if you're like me, what you'll do is the problem will come up and you try to problem solve. And what I do oftentimes is when it's a problem out of my control, in other words, it's the what ifs, wonder what that test result will be when I go to the doctor. I wonder, I wonder what that decision will be by somebody who I don't have control over, whether my job is around in six months from now, it'd be the things that I can't control. I start thinking worst case scenario. Now, I pride myself in this. I'll just say worst case scenario. And before you know it, I've ruminated on this thing and gone six or seven steps deep, right? I'm like, okay, here's how we'll sell the house, and here's how we'll go. And all this anxiety builds up in me, and I'm thinking thoughts that are not even close to what might be true. But Jesus says, yes, we're going to have many trials and sorrows, but take courage. I have overcome the world. Which one am I thinking about? The problem or the promise that I follow a victorious king. He's overcome the world. I can ruminate all I want to. I can chew on the source or I can choose to diligently focus on the promise. I can ruminate on the feelings. And feelings are always real. We can't help oftentimes how we feel, but they're not always reliable. I talked to a guy this week. I feel alone and abandoned by God and others. The more we talked, I said, wait a second, let's look at your schedule. Look at how God has put all these people in your life. People that are calling you, people that are caring for you. God hasn't abandoned you. He's using his people to be right near you. But when we feel that way, it becomes truth and we chew on it. What's the fact? What about the lies that we believe? Oftentimes what I try to do is I draw a line down the middle of my journal and I'm like, what are the lies I believe? And I ask God, God, help me see those lies, and I just write them out. And then my strategy, this may sound overly simple, I try to find a verse in Scripture or a couple of verses that counteract that lie. And then instead of ruminating on those lies, I meditate on those truths. Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers, but his delight is in the law of the Lord. And on his law, he meditates both day and night. He is like a tree that's planted near streams of water. So that means that he yields his fruit in its season and its leaf doesn't wither. In other words, when times are tough, when depression and anxiety is breathing down his neck, he doesn't wither underneath that pressure. Instead, Scripture says, he prospers in all he does. Doesn't mean magically the depression or the anxiety goes away, but he or she are making a conscious choice and effort to say, I'm gonna choose to think about this. I'm not going to chew on the problems, the feelings, the lies. I'm going to choose to focus on the promises, the facts, and the truth. Apostle Paul says, being anxious for nothing but in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. In other words, as this anxiety builds up in our lives, and we're going to talk more about this in just a couple of weeks, we pray and we connect with God. And then he says, And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding or all comprehension, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus, will guard your hearts, your emotions, and will guard your minds, your thoughts. And then he finishes with this. He says, Now, brothers and sisters whatever is true here's his list whatever is honorable what are you writing down on your list whatever's just pure lovely commendable what is it what is it that you're choosing to meditate on rather than chewing a negative thought chewing on a negative emotion chewing on a negative outcome or circumstance. He says, the moral excellence praiseworthy. Watch what he says. Dwell. A focused thought on these things. Again, please do not hear me saying this is easy to do, but it's very effective. It's very effective because this is how God created us. And notice, as I replace some of those negative things, some of those chewing things with choosing things, there's a promise in here. Don't look at me. Look at the screen. You see the promise. And this is what I love about the promise. It's not just that you and I are going to experience the peace of God. What does it say? It's the God of peace will be with you. You want to experience the peace of God and the presence of God? You make a choice to choose not to chew. Here at Fearless Church, because we don't hide, and because we're committed to take new ground, what we're going to do in the next few weeks is we're going to do our very best in an introductory way to learn how to fight. How to fight depression and anxiety. I want you to log on or show up next week. If you can't show up on Sunday, log in when you can because we're going to address depression. The following week, we're going to address anxiety. And we're going to talk about how anxiety is connected to depression. Some of you may already know that, but there's some connections that we need to be aware of and the last week the last week you don't want to miss is a week where we're going to talk about going the distance because with depression and with anxiety even if you've never dealt with it your friends and family that have dealt with it your neighbors the people you talk to they will tell you it sometimes it goes away a week later but oftentimes it it's a long fight. So how do we as fearless followers of Jesus step in the ring and fight the good fight for a long time against depression and anxiety? What if, what if today you choose not to? You say, I choose, I choose to take every thought captive and to pick up the weapons of warfare, God's word, God's spirit, God's people, and I choose to put on my gloves, to step in the ring and fight this thing. What if the hope, the peace, the joy, the abundant life God has for you is just on the other side of a new way to fight this thing called depression and anxiety. May we be found, as the Apostle Paul says it is, end of his life. I fought the good fight. I fought it God's way. I didn't conform to the pattern of the world. I transformed my thinking, and I am taking every thought captive. Let's fight well and see what God will do over the next few weeks in our hearts and our lives. Let me pray for us. Heavenly Father, thank you so much for the words of the Apostle Paul. Lord, this is not an easy thing. We need your help. Help us, God, learn how to choose what's right, to choose what's lovely, to choose what's pure, to choose what's righteous, to choose what's commendable. All these things help us choose the right way to think about these topics instead of chewing on the negative and ruminating on the things that weigh us down and feed, actually feed into the stronghold lies that grip us and rip us apart towards depression and anxiety. God, I pray for healing. Lord, by the power and authority of Jesus Christ, I pray over the next month there would be healing and there would be progress that people would experience a joy and a peace and a hope and a satisfaction like they've never done before. God, help us as we dive in to these otherwise subjects that we don't really feel comfortable talking about and learn. Learn not only for ourselves, but those in and around our lives. we love you we pray these things in jesus name amen amen."}]}

Finally, challenge the congregation to consider how refocusing on God can improve their attitudes, decision-making, and relationships with others."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here at Fearless we want to be a church who starts churches both locally and globally. Why do we do this? Because today over 42% of the global population has little to no access to the gospel. That means over 3 billion people will wake up tomorrow not having an opportunity to hear about the God who loves them, who created them, who sent His only Son to rescue them. Church it can't be this way. God has positioned us to advance the gospel to people and places who have never heard about Jesus. So what do we do? We start churches and we engage unreached people groups. This year, God blessed us with an opportunity to start our very first multiplying church. We sent out pastors Chris Volz and Matt Missler with a team of over 50 people to go and start for Dayton. We also continue to strengthen and develop our partnership with the India Gospel League, who focuses on over 500 million people that live in the most unreached rural villages of India. Fearless Church, all of us together have an opportunity to be more. And it does take all of us to start churches and to reach unreached people groups. Every year at this time, we take what we call our Be More offering. It is an opportunity for us to pray and ask God, how would we partner with what He is doing around the world? Last year, we challenged you to go and pray and say, hey, what would you want me to give? And you as a church generously gave over $50,000 to our Be More efforts. And every dollar that you gave, every dollar that you give goes directly into reaching unreached people. And so we're challenging you again this year. We want you to pray. We want you to ask God, how do I contribute? How do I give? What resource am I willing to offer up to partner in this great effort to be a multiplying church? We want to make it as simple as possible for you. We encourage all of you. Visit our website, BeFearless.org. And on our homepage, you'll see a link you can click. It will take you right to our Be More page where you can get more information and you can give easily. Begin to pray now consider what you consider what your family might do to reach people around the world well good morning to all of you and as i just said which is always weird when you walk out and you're the one on the screen right we do encourage you to continue to think continue to talk continue to pray about what god might have you do to contribute to the be more offering throughout this season we highlight this throughout the rest of the year if you've been around fearless we don't talk a lot about money we have a we have a heart here that we never want someone to feel obligated to give to feel pressed to give we only want people to respond to what it is that god is saying so when we do talk about offering, it's always for something that goes outside these doors. And so all of our Be More offering does go to serve in our local community and church planting and making disciples, but also around the world as we reach unreached people groups and try to plant churches there as well. So you have through the month of December to continue to go online, and you can find out how to give and if that is right for you and your family. All right. Well, I don't know about you. It's hard for me to believe that we're already in the first Sunday of December of 2022. I feel like we were just in December of 2021. And some of you are excited, though, about this time of year because you love Christmas. You started decorating in August. You know that. There are some of you who have a little more temperance. I get that too. And so you say, hey, there's a date when I start my decorating, or there's a certain date that's appropriate to listen to Christmas music. And then there's another group of you who say, I would probably jettison it all if I could come December. Listen, there's all kinds of different pros and cons to the holiday season, all kinds of different ways to look at it, different feels for different people. There are some people, honestly, wake up in December and all they think is, man, it is colder. Truly. I mean, it is damp, it is chilly, and not only that, it's dark. I get up in the morning and I go to work in the dark and I get in my car and I come home at night in the dark. And the worst part is if you ever leave your car outside in a parking lot in the driveway, occasionally you have to scrape it off. It is a cold time of year. Some of you look at that and you think, no, no, it's cozier. Yeah, I come home in the dark and you know what? That's why I have flannel sheets and footie pajamas and a fireplace and a book and hot chocolate sitting on the couch, blankets everywhere, right? This is a cozy time of year. For some people, it's busier. It's an addition of activities. A lot of things kind of jump in front. Christmas activities, maybe it's decorating. You're doing things around the house. You've got family stuff, extended family, close family. If you've got kids, grandkids, nieces, nephews, they have recitals, they have concerts, they have shows. And if you have multiple kids if you have multiple kids you have multiple concerts and multiple shows it's busier you're like now it's merrier and you know why it's merrier because my kids have multiple shows and multiple concerts and i get to decorate the house and i have all this activity how about this one it is expensiver and i know what you're thinking that is not a real word And I know what you're thinking, that is not a real word. Your bank statement says otherwise. We give gifts. It's big things. It's the secret Santa things at work or at school, right? Sometimes you have to go out to different dinners or you're doing hospitality. It's year-end teacher gifts. All these different things cost money. It's expensive. It's expensive. But really, it's big-hearted-er. Some people say, no, no. No, this is my chance. It's not that I have to give people gifts. It's my opportunity to actually get to give people gifts. I get to bless other people. I get to help people in need. I get to surprise people with generosity. Listen, it's Christmas. No matter what lens you look through, one thing is true. It rings true almost every holiday for every person, regardless of your feel, and it's this. This season is often complicated-er. It just is. You got schedules, yes. Relationships, yes. Finances, yes. But on top of that, you've got emotions that jump in this time of year. You've got expectations. You've got traditions. You've got traditions. You have things that you have the rest of the year, but for some reason, in this moment, in December, things get heightened, and you're so much more aware of what's happening. It's complicated. And in the middle of it all, what I think everyone would say, I wish I could have, is not complicated-er, but simpler. Simpler. And it's not because you want to jettison Christmas. You're not necessarily thinking you want to just get rid of all of the things that make Christmas Christmas. You don't want something lackluster. You don't want to lack spirit or joy. You don't want to give up on the festivities of all of Christmas. No, you want simpler. Simpler means you want something purposeful. You want to, when you're in the middle of these things, feel more present. You want something meaningful. You want something memorable. Ultimately, you want that. You want a simpler Christmas. And if that's what you want, or if it's something you ever thought you might want, this series is for you. This series is for you. We're here to help, starting today. Today and for a couple more weeks leading up to Christmas, we're going to talk about helping you celebrate and enjoy this idea of a simpler Christmas. We want to help you consider some things where you might better manage your time and your schedule, how you might better manage people that creep into your life this time of year. How to manage some of the traditions and the expectations that surround the season. So this is really about practical, kind of down-to-earth, helpful tips, reminders that everybody needs to hear this time of year. And so we're going to kick off today by considering a reminder about maybe how we would manage our time. Something that will speak a little bit to our calendars and a little bit to our schedule during the holiday season. And here's why. Because it goes without saying that how we spend our time influences how we experience Christmas, for good or for bad. How we spend our time, it's how we experience Christmas. It can certainly be a busier time of year, no question. There are additional things that jump on your schedule sometimes you put them there by choice many times other people put them there by their choice but it's not just your additional activities it is those additional people we joke about it but there are certain people that you will only see this time of year extended family even friends maybe even co-workers that you don't normally spend time with show up, and you end up spending time with them at Christmas. You have these additional relationships. And what happens during the season is we don't remove anything. We simply add things. And so when it comes to our time, we just put more in the pot, right? We kind of pack it in. We put it on top and kind of fill in all of the cracks. And not long into that, it becomes a bit of a balancing game. And for all of us, it doesn't take long to become out of balance. And nobody's immune to that, because no matter how well prepared you are, no matter how scripted you are in your holiday, things just seem to jump on the schedule. You ever deal with unexpected things at the holidays? A lot of unexpected things, sometimes urgent things. And if something is unexpected, especially if it's urgent, guess what? It pushes its way to the front of the line. That's what happens. And we react and we respond to the things that are in front of us at the moment. We start to get distracted. And before long, we start to spread our time thinner and thinner. And inevitably, when that happens, there's stress, and there's strain, and it kind of creeps into our life, and the things that we care about the most starts to actually get the least amount of our attention. We stop giving our best time to the people and the things we care about most. And it's not that your world comes crashing down. It's not that it's a crisis in December, but here's what happens. You start to drift through your days. Have you ever felt that? You drift through another day, and another day, and then another week, and another week, and all of a sudden it's a month, and you might wake up in early January and literally think to yourself, what just happened to the holiday? And that drift goes on and on. Listen, all of us are prone to drift in the holidays. It's a universal challenge to stay purposeful, to stay present, to find meaning in the middle of the season. And so we're going to talk a little bit about how to spend our best time, how to spend our time, because it's going to influence how we experience Christmas. And so today is all about one reminder. I'm just going to make it very simple. It's one reminder. It is one word of encouragement. Ultimately, today is just one challenge, one challenge that I think will serve all of us well if we're looking to have a simpler Christmas. And the challenge is this. We, we in this season, we need to take the time to refocus regularly. We need to build in this habit of refocusing, and we need to do it over and over again. In other words, we set a habit, we set a pattern of life that is allowing us to set our hearts and minds on those things that matter most. And I'm going to say this right up front because I recognize what some of you are thinking. This is not a revolutionary concept. We said it already this morning, right? Jesus is the reason for the season, right? Well, how do we lose focus on that? It's really not that simple. We know that's true. But then I think to myself, if I know it's true, and I know it's so obvious, and I think I've got this. How come I continue to drift and I walk through my days in an aimless, non-present fashion? How come year after year I fall into the same trap and the same habits and I find myself waking up missing major moments of what's in front of me? Listen, today is not about new information. It's really not. Refocusing regularly. It's not new information. It is a reminder that we've got to set in front of ourselves. It's an important reminder, but I'm glad that we have an example to turn to, and that's what we're going to do today. Jesus Himself, that One who is the epicenter of Christmas, Jesus Himself prioritized this right here. Jesus set an amazing example for us as a man who refocused regularly as he walked on the earth. You may already know this, but the Bible has what we call four Gospels. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Four writers, four individual writers, and they write about the life and times of Jesus. Why? Because we get four perspectives about who Jesus was, the things that he did, the places that he went. And if you look through the Gospels, what you'll see is that Jesus actually had to deal with a lot of things that you and I have to deal with. Jesus had activities, had a lot of people, he had a lot of expectations, and he had to, just like we do, work very intentionally to maintain some kind of sense of balance in his busy days. And I really do believe that some of Jesus' secret sauce was this right here. How did he maintain balance? Because Jesus set the tone when it came to refocusing regularly. I'm going to pick on one story today. The gospel writer Mark, he writes about a very busy day that Jesus had. And to set the stage, Jesus is with some of his disciples. They're in the city of Capernaum. And we simply read this. It says, when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue. And it says, he began to teach. Now, if you know anything about the Jewish culture, Sabbath day was a day of rest, right? Great. No work. In fact, you were kind of banished from having to add workload. But that wasn't true for Jesus. He was a rabbi. In other words, he was a sought-after teacher. And so for him, he went to work. It was a work day for him. And so he went to teaching in the synagogue. And if you were to read the narrative in Mark, you'd find out it was actually a very difficult day of teaching because in the midst of that, he got interrupted. There was this guy that showed up. thing in the middle of everybody else. So he stopped his teaching. He handled this guy, went back to his teaching, ultimately finished up his morning. And that's just how things began. From there, it was supposed to get easier because as soon as they left the synagogue, it says they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. And presumptively, they take that walk. They head over to some friend's house, just like you might when you leave here, thinking, I'm going to go home. I'm going to get some food. I'm going to get some downtime. Maybe I'll take a nap. I'll probably turn on the game, right? I don't think they turned on the game. I don't know what Simon and Andrew's cable situation was. Probably not great. Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever. So, they there and plans are about to change. His mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and guess what? They immediately tell who? They tell Jesus about her. So fresh off of this full morning of ministry and care, Jesus is now called back into action. It's something that is unexpected, and in this case, it's very urgent and it takes priority. And again, some of you know how that feels, walking back into your house and finding some unexpected and urgent things. And so Jesus does what Jesus does. Instead of taking the downtime, he spends time healing, comforting, managing this friend's mother-in-law and most likely everybody else in the house. And with all of that stuff behind him, they finally sit down, they do have a meal and you think it's all settled in, but it says that that And with all of that stuff behind them, they finally sit down, they do have a meal, and you think it's all settled in, but it says that that evening after sunset, so Sabbath would run right up until sunset, and as soon as sunset hit, that kind of meant Sabbath was over, and it says as soon as sunset, people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. In fact, it says the whole town gathered at the door. Sometimes I think my life is busy. Then I ask myself the question, when's the last time an entire city showed up at my door unannounced, right? See, Jesus knew firsthand. He knew firsthand this experience of activity and busyness and expectation. Jesus had a front row seat to the pressure and demands of life. And in the face of it all, he did what he often did. He served. It says that Jesus healed many with various diseases. He served people. He was selfless. He extended himself. He worked hard. He had a lot of these kinds of days, a lot of full days. A lot of you have a lot of full days. You've got a lot of things on your calendar, and yet you serve. You do. You serve people around you. You care for people around you. You extend yourself. You go to work. You are a good employee. You are a good student. You put in the work. And so, Jesus stood there in the middle of this, realizing, I have got to be careful. And as we stand in our busyness, we know that we have to be careful. Jesus had to be careful that he did not drift. And so he had kind of this conscious idea that he needed to be refreshed. He always seemed to know in his heart that he needed to find the rest and get refocused. Jesus needed to refocus regularly, and that's exactly what he did. It says very early in the morning. So right after the heels of that day, he said, well, it was still dark. He got up. He left. He left the house, and he went off to a solitary place, and he prayed. Jesus intentionally stepped away. He took a breath. He took a moment. He said, I'm going to refocus. He said said I'm going to spend some time with my father I'm going to spend a few minutes with God because I know I need it and again that's Jesus the son of God you see and Mark shares this story this one particular story as an example but if you were to walk through the gospels I'm going to do it briefly you'll see that this is not a strange occurrence for Jesus this is not an isolated event in the same gospel, Mark says there was a time there were so many people coming and going that they, that means Jesus and all the people with him, his core disciples, they didn't even have a chance to eat. Some of you reconcile that as well. Didn't even have a chance to eat, and Jesus said, come with me by yourselves to a quiet place to do what? Get some rest. To do what? Get some rest. In other words, let's get out of here. And they did. They went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place. Jesus got tracked by religious leaders all the time, came under intense pressure and scrutiny and expectation. And it says that Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake. Major decision-making time. Jesus had to figure out who the 12 closest followers were going to be some of you know the story jesus chose 12 individuals that he was going to walk with for a period of years but before he do that he said jesus went out he went out where to a mountainside to pray he spent the night praying to god he got refocused before that decision another time a tragic event occurred one of of his best friends, ministry partners, John the Baptist, was killed tragically, and it says when Jesus heard what happened, what did he do? He withdrew. He withdrew by a boat to a private place, to a solitary place. Over and over in different places, we see this experience. It was not an isolated event. People came to Jesus all the time. They always had something they wanted Him to do. It was not an isolated event. People came to Jesus all the time. They always had something they wanted him to do. He was there and available to help them and to serve them. But Luke says it very plainly, Jesus often withdrew. He often withdrew to lonely places. And he prayed. Jesus made it a very clear priority to step away, to get in focus, to connect with God. If he needed to make an important decision, that might be a moment to reconnect. If he needed to process his emotions, he stepped away to connect with God. If he needed to care for his own soul, find rest, deal well with other people, if he needed to just break away from the noise, he stepped away. In other words, taking these moments, taking these times intentionally to connect with God, they helped him to live well. They did. They helped him to continue to live well, and more importantly, it helped him to love well. It set him up to deal well with the people in his life. And the truth is, he not just refocused, he had to do it regularly. Why? Because all of the energy, all of the people, the activity, the expectations that came at him And the truth is, he not just refocused, he had to do it regularly. Why? Because all of the energy, all of the people, the activity, the expectations that came at him on the front end, guess what happened when he stepped away and came back? It was still there. Still there. Back to the original story, he did get up and he left early and he went to a solitary place and he prayed. And you know what? They came to find him. How's that for a rest break, right? Simon and his companions, they went and they found him. And when they found him, they just said, aren't you glad you're resting? No, that's not what they said. They said, everyone is looking for you. Everyone is looking for you. Listen, the busyness, the activities, the people, they're going to be there on the front end. And after you're in our life, they're not bad things. The activities in our life are not the bad things. We put them on the calendar. Other people put them on the calendar, but they're worthwhile. They're useful. The things we do with friends, the things we do with family, the things we do to serve and honor others, those are good things. People are not the problem either. Yes, people come with expectations. Yes, you have things you need to care for in your life. They're not the issue. The real issue is that all of that, the activities, the people, the expectations, it could cause drift. That's what it does. It simply distracts us from the main thing, and it pulls us away from the stuff we care about the most. And Jesus, I think, really knew that. He understood it, and he said, I'm going to get away and I'm going to refocus regularly. And I think by doing that, he's saying, so should we. So should we. We should regularly, consistently, periodically spend time, spend these moments with God. Because we as a people, we do need this space to refocus and get reset. We need to step away from some of the distractions of life and the noise around us. And if we do that, it will help us to do what Jesus did. If we step away from time to time to connect with God, it will help us to live well. It will help us to make some better decisions about where we spend time and energy. It will help us center on things that matter most, and it will help us to love well. it will help us to better interact with the people in our lives that we care about you see jesus prepared us for the christmas season he said you need to re focus regularly so the question really is if we want a simpler christmas how can we do this how can we do this what does this look like for us? And I mean in today's world, like in the real world, right? Some of you might be thinking, I like this idea. I like the idea of stepping away. In fact, I would love to just get up in the morning someday and walk out of my house and leave it alone and take a retreat for a while. But we all know it's just not that easy because you cannot wake up and just not go to work. That doesn't work. Some of you have scheduled travel. A lot of you have very real obligations. Some of you have family you have to care for. You've got kids that live in your house. You've got aging parents. You've got people at work. You've got demands. It's not like you're just going to skip everything. You're not just going to bypass everything in the Christmas season and jettison all of that for the sake of your time away. So how does it really work? Does it have to look just like it did for Jesus? I don't know if you noticed this. I'm like, Jesus always has a boat at the ready. Did you notice that? Some of you in the room right now, you're like, yeah, this is a great message. We're going to get a boat for Christmas. That's the takeaway. No Christmas. That's the takeaway. Now, right? He's always finding a mountainside. There's no mountainside in Ohio. So what does this look like? Well, I'll tell you this. I think it's possible to find key time and key moments with God, but it doesn't have to look just like it did for Jesus. I don't believe that. Those gospel writers, they highlight specific times, specific moments where Jesus did take some concentrated time away. They described for us something that Jesus did. But in the way that Jesus did it, that is not a prescription for us. It's not about how he did it. It's why he did it. And that's the prompt. The prompt is the why. It's the big idea. It's about taking intentional moments. You and I, in today's world, finding intentional moments, even small ones, even small ones, finding intentional moments even small ones even small ones where we connect or reconnect with God and hear me I think there's intense value in taking extended time away for renewal go ahead and do that if you can for some of you you may even have a daily set time that you carve out to be with God but I'm saying there are ways for all of us to connect with god in the middle in the middle of an actual real sort of busy kind of day and sometimes i think even those small steps those small regular moments to connect with god add up to something important one i think it can actually create habits for us finding small moments in the day to connect with god creates a habit of connecting with god more than that it allows us to get refreshment in and throughout key moments of our work day, our school day, and our family life. And so as we kind of walk into the finish today, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to offer up kind of a simple practical idea. Simple practical idea. And you can connect with God in this way. And you can take it or leave it. In other words, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm simply giving you an idea to get your wheels turning. What would this look like for me in the holiday season? So here we go. I'm going to encourage you to do this somehow over Christmas. I want you to add something, and I want you to subtract something. I want you to add something and subtract something, and I'm going to explain this. Here's what I want you to add. I want you to think about your day and I want you to figure out how can you add something that serves as a reminder to connect with God. That's the addition. I want you to add something to your day that serves as a prompt and a reminder that I am going to be intentional about connecting with God. But then there's a subtraction piece, meaning there may be something in your current life, your But then there's a subtraction piece, meaning there may be something in your current life, your current schedule, your current habit that you need to remove so that you actually have the space to connect with God. In other words, there may be something you want to swap out, something you're currently doing and you want to do it a different way or with something new. So, for example, you want to add something, right? Here's a suggestion. Add a physical reminder, a physical reminder somewhere in your life during the course of the day. And again, we go back to a classic, a post-it note. Something as simple as that. It could be a post-it note, can be a sticker. Put a sticker somewhere where you'll see it. Maybe it's on your coffee mug. Maybe it's on a water bottle. Somewhere where you are regularly intentionally. If you want to see it in the morning because that's when you need to connect with God, put it on the mirror in your bathroom. Put it on the dashboard of your car so every day when you get to work and you're in the parking lot, you see that thing there. Put it on your desk. Put it on your computer screen. Set it somewhere on your TV. Do something. It's just a bright pink piece of paper, yellow, whatever it is, and when you see it, it doesn't even have to say anything, but what does it say to you? Oh, that's right. I need to take a moment and maybe connect with God and maybe that moment is now. And again, hear me, when I say connect with God, I don't mean go off and drive off in a boat. I'm saying it might be 30 seconds right there. You're just like, I'm going to pray for these 30 seconds. I'm going to connect with God for one minute. I'm just going to stop and push pause and put my phone down and take a moment. So physical reminder, set it somewhere. Maybe you wear something. Put one of those plastic bracelets on, right? If you have favorite earrings, wear favorite earrings. I don't know, it's a piece of clothing. Get a big tattoo on your forearm. Just something tasteful, right? Something that when you see it is that reminder that I want to connect with God. Physical reminder. More than that, how about a digital reminder? Most of you have one of these. I don't know how many times a day I look at this thing. Probably 540,000. I don't know. But I'm always looking at the lock screen just to see what time it is. How many of you know that you can change your lock screen, right? Find something, just a picture, a graphic. Maybe it's a text, a scripture says reconnect. It's just a reminder throughout your day. Maybe you got a watch. You can program that, right? Put it on your watch face. Put it there. Maybe set an actual reminder, like set an alarm. Some people do that. They set an alarm on their phone. They set an alarm on their watch. They set an alarm in the house somewhere, and maybe it goes off at the same time every day. And you may or may not be able to, in that moment, connect same time every day. And you may or may not be able to, in that moment, connect with God, but it is that reminder again that pulls you out of whatever you're doing to say, oh, that's right. I want to be intentional about this. Set it for a lunch break if you're at school. Set it for a coffee break. Set it somewhere when that alarm goes off. You know you have 30 seconds, two minutes, five minutes, whatever it is, to stay connected with God. Do a digital reminder. Better yet, do a personal reminder. You want to take it up a notch, phone a friend, right? Add someone to your list. Swap with somebody. It could be somebody in your house, or maybe it's somebody else in your life, and just say, hey, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to text you. I'm going to text you. Maybe it's not once a day, but maybe it's once a week. And I'm just going to text you, and I'm literally just going to say, have you reconnected? That's all. Have you refocused? Okay. And maybe they text back. You text them back and forth, and it's just a reminder, a reminder, a reminder. So add that. Add that. If you don't, if you don't, what will happen? It will escape your mind. It is so important to add something because reminders are needed. They naturally serve to break us out of our typical habits and routines, all the things that we do. Otherwise, it will fall through the cracks. So add something. But then on top of that, subtract something. Subtract something. In other words, you need to find some actual space to connect with God. And I know in the course of a busy day, it can be difficult to do. So here's what I'd encourage. Maybe it's a swap. Maybe you just say, hey, something I normally do, I'm going to do it in a different way. So for example, I drive in the car a few different times a day. So I commute every day here. I commute to work and I commute home. 15 to 20 minutes each time. I like to listen to sports radio. Any other sports radio people, right? ESPN, ESPN2, PJ Tour, NFL. Like, I got it all, right? I've got a full plethora of that. Some of you listen to talk radio. Some of you put podcasts on. Some of you listen to books. What if, what if I subtracted that? Not all the time, but maybe just once in a while. So just on my commute in in the morning, what if I turned the radio off? You ever sat in silence in your car before? It's kind of a strange experience. But you sit in your car, and maybe it's only a five-minute drive, but it might be a 30-minute drive. And if you sit in the quiet, I realize it's not a deep deep intense time to connect with God. You still have to drive. But the reality is in those quiet moments, you can. You can refocus. You can connect with God. You can pray and meditate. Maybe you just put on some worship music instead of listening to what it always is. And maybe that's your retune for one week. Just change that routine. You subtract whatever it is you're listening to and you swap that out for some time of quiet or some time of worship. Maybe you do it with your workouts, maybe you go for a walk, whatever you put in your earbuds, whatever you're always listening to in your headphones, change it up, swap something out, subtract something you always listen to, put on something else. Some of you may actually physically want to fast for a meal. What do you do? Subtract a lunch. It's not a huge deal. You don't have to fast for 40 days or anything like that, but maybe, maybe for once a week or something like that, you decide, hey, instead of having lunch today, like I always do, I'm going to go out and drive and grab something and come back home. No, I'm going to sit at my desk or I'm going to sit where I am, whatever that happens to be, and I'm going to take those few minutes instead of eating today. It is a current reminder that I want to connect with God. And so you get refocused by fasting. Some of you make a morning coffee run. I'm just giving you ideas. Again, you don't have to do these. I'm going to step on some toes. Now you make a morning coffee run. Like you go to Dunkin', you go to Starbucks every day, that is a routine. That is your habit. And maybe you're one of those people that sits in that drive-thru for 15 minutes every day. And every time you're in the drive-thru, you're on your phone, and you're checking texts, and you're doing emails, and you're doing this, and you're checking your Facebook. You're doing all of that. Don't do that. Sit in the drive-thru moment. Now, don't skip your coffee. Don't do that. That is not a good habit. But while you're spending that time, redeem the time. Take those 15 minutes at the drive-through and say, I am going to let this be my time of quiet. It may be as simple as every stoplight you hit instead of immediately, I don't know if you don't do this, I realize. There are other drivers that actually look at their phone while they're sitting at red lights. Don't do that. Don't pick up your phone and start scrolling. Let every 30 seconds to 60 seconds at a red light be an opportunity to say, God, I'm here, I'm listening. Say something. God, I'm here, I'm focusing on you. I've got to deal with this later today. I just want to pray about this just for a moment, right? It sounds so easy, but you do have to subtract something out of your daily habit, your daily routine, and insert something else in it. And you may need to pull out some things. Social media, you may need to pull out some time on your apps. You may need to pull out some time binging certain shows. You may need to pull away from some things so that you can insert some things. You have to subtract something in the season to give yourself some space. So you add something. In other words, make yourself a reminder that says, I want to connect. And then challenge yourself to find something, something unique to you that just might say, hey, once a day, it might be multiple times a day, again, just for 30 to 60 seconds, to say, I'm going to reconnect with God in this moment. Listen, what were to happen, what were to happen if we were to do this? If we were to take these one to two options over the course of three to four weeks and deliberately reconnect with God in the course of the holiday? If you did this every day in some way, do you think it might change your some way do you think it might change your attitude do you think it might change your decision making do you think it would change some relationships if you took a moment you actually reconnected with god would it change the way you interact with that guy at work that girl at work that neighbor would it change the way you respond to your parents would it change the way that you respond to your kids right would it change the way you respond to your parents? Would it change the way that you respond to your kids? Would it change the way that you interact with the people in your life? Would they notice a difference? I think they would. I think they would. If we refocused regularly, if we took the time to connect with God in regular intervals, I don't think it would make for a perfect trouble-free Christmas. But I do think, I do think if you took the time to refocus regularly, you will be glad you did. And I think there will be somebody else that is glad you did as well. And so let's not wake up in January and wonder where December went. Let's try to stay focused and connected on the things and the people that matter most in the season. Let me pray for you. We'll wrap up today. Father God, you gave us a tremendous example. As you sent Jesus, yes, he's fully God, he's fully man. But he, even in his own right, needed the conscious steps of refocusing, of connecting with you, to be able to live the life that he did, to be able to love people in the way that he did. And God, we don't want to lose sight of you in this season, in any season. But right now, we don't want to lose sight of you. So God, prompt us, prompt us today throughout our weeks ahead to find those moments with you where you will speak to us in a powerful way. We thank you for it in Jesus' name. Amen."}]}

No! Yes, I do. I do think it's a good idea, if you're going to play airsoft, that you be shot with an airsoft gun first. I said, Dad, are you sure? I'm positive. I know what I'm doing. It's kind of cold outside and it's dark, so let's go in the garage and do this thing. So I line both the boys up. I look at them and I think, you know what? Maybe a little wisdom applied here would be good. Why don't you turn around? Let's not mess up the moneymaker. So I pull out the airsoft gun. If you don't know what an airsoft gun is, they shoot little BBs that are not soft, that are plastic. And so I proceed to prepare my boys. If they're going to play this game, they got to be ready. Pop, pop. Ah, they both hit their knees. I had my doubts, but I still knew I've done the right thing. They go inside and proceed to tell mom. That's exactly right. Christelle pulls up the back of their shirts. And it's interesting that airsoft leaves some marks so Christelle proceeds to ask me and she said hey Chris are you kidding me do you think it was a good idea to shoot our sons with airsoft guns to buy myself some time I took a drink of my coffee mistakes were made mistakes were made in my family goes like this we have one very responsible smart parent and we have one that has a lot of great don't do this type lessons that they teach i'll let you figure out which one it is when it comes to parenting i don't do this type lessons that they teach. I'll let you figure out which one it is. When it comes to parenting, I don't know if you feel like you're a success or if you've got a bunch of stories just like mine where there's some things that you've done that you wish maybe you could redo. And so some of you are going to walk away today and you say, hey man, like I'm going to shoot my kid with airsoft. Don't do that. That's what it's not to do. So today we're jumping back into our message series entitled Not a Nanny. And this series is all about this reality that as moms, as dads, as step-parents, our goal is not just to feed and care for and provide for our kids. Our goal is much bigger than that. It's actually a goal to raise fearless followers of Jesus. That these little boys, these little girls that we have influence on would become mighty men and women of God. Now, before we dive in, I want to talk to those in the room that you would say, now, this is the hard part about a message like this, because I don't have kids living in my home. Maybe you're an empty nester and your kids are grown. And some of the stuff we share may be encouraging. Some of it may be discouraging, right? Or maybe you're somebody that right now, you as a husband and wife, you're trying everything to have children, but for whatever reason, God has not chosen to bless you with an opportunity to adopt or natural birth. And so you jump into a series like this and you're like, man, I'm, I don't know. This series isn't just informational. This series is personal. Like it hurts, or maybe you're single and you're looking for that man or that woman that God has for you in your life. And one day you want to have a family, but you're in this waiting phase. Or maybe you're like, dude, I don't even like kids, right? And you feel disconnected. Now, here's what I want to challenge you. Here's what I want to challenge you. If you're in the category that you don't have kids living in your home, either as a grandparent, an aunt and uncle, or mom and dad, step parents, foster parents, whatever that may be. If you say there's no kids living in my home, I want to remind you what we said last week. This is not their mission. It's our mission. It's not their mission. Those who are step parents, who are parents, grandparents, it's not the mission of all of us together. It's our mission to raise up the next generation to know and walk with Christ, to have a dynamic, genuine faith that looks almost fearless. So here's what I want to challenge you. There's a great prophet in the Old Testament. He said this, the word of God never returns void. So in a few moments, I'm going to put up some scripture on the screen. You're going to read it and I'm going to read it returns void. So in a few moments, I'm going to put up some scripture on the screen. You're going to read it, and I'm going to read it out loud. So you're going to hear it, and you're going to be able to read it. And if the prophet was correct that when God's word is spoken or when it's read, it never returns void, then you're going to get something this morning. Even if you're not a parent. Even if you don't have kids still living in your own. If you're in that category, God is not going to allow his word to be proclaimed and it come back void or useless or not effective. So I want to challenge you, and I'm going to lead us in a quick prayer, to pray three things. Number one, God, what do you want to teach me about yourself? This is something I pray. Anytime any member of our teaching team is here, even when I'm opening my Bible in the morning, I'm like, God, what do you want to teach me about yourself? Because there's some moments it's not about us at all, and we need to make sure we're remembering that and saying, God, there's some things you want to show me just about yourself. The second one, God, what do you want to teach me about me? There might be something God me to teach others like today if you don't have a kid living in your home i encourage you to take notes like never before to prepare yourself because you may have a conversation tomorrow you're not planning at all and it may be a conversation god's like i'm preparing you i'm equipping you because i want you to be able to speak this truth to apply this text and help that person as they're coming to know jesus christ or grow in Christ or be a parent themselves or a foster parent whatever that may be so what do you want me God what do you want me to teach you or what do you want to teach me about you what do you want me to teach about myself or maybe what do you want me to teach others let's pray together and let's just pray that prayer not out loud I'll pray out loud you just pray quietly God we're asking you, Lord, as we jump into this series, jump back in, what do you want to teach us about yourself? And I just encourage you to say, God, I'm listening. Father, what do you want to teach us about ourselves? I just encourage you to say, God, I'm listening. If there's something you want to tell me about me, I'm listening. And then finally, God, is there something you want to teach me today that you're planning for me to teach others? Am I taking notes for somebody else other than myself today? If that's the case, God, I'm listening. Father, that's our desire, to come in this room and not to hear some preacher on stage, but to hear you. God, teach us today how to know this text and apply this text and more than anything, how to know and love and obey you. We love you and pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, last week we kicked off and we said, before we dive in and get specific about our homes, let's go back to our church mission, why we exist. And we say it this way. We want to be fearless followers of Jesus who changed the world. So it's not just enough that we would come to know Jesus Christ in a personal way and grow in our faith. It's not about just us. It's Jesus, even when he was first rounding up disciples, he said, come follow me and I will make you fishers of men. Like I'm going to use you to change the world. And you may not believe that God wants to use you, but I know based on what scripture says, and I know as I see it in you as your pastor, God wants to do things in your life and through your life. There's things he's teaching you now that he's preparing you to use in the future. Maybe it's this week, maybe it's next month, maybe it's next year. But God sees what he can do infinitely more than all you can ask or imagine in and through your life. You are made to change the world. Now, this mission comes from our calling, our calling. So if our mission is why we exist, our calling is what we do. And we can't just make that up. That has to come from the one that we follow, Jesus. After the resurrection, Jesus taught and did some amazing things for about 40 days. And then he ascended to the father. One of the last things we have recorded that Jesus said to his disciples. And now I believe in 2021 would say to anyone in this room who wants to follow Jesus or is following Jesus. He said this, I want you to go make disciples of all nations, the entire world. In other words, I want you to go change the world by making disciples. This is overwhelmingly clear. But if you're a follower of Jesus, it's also clearly overwhelming. Like in this room, if we were just to be honest and say, okay, raise your hand really, really high. If you believe right now, you are ready to leave out this morning. Go change the world by making disciples. Most of us say, come on, dude. Like I'm barely a disciple myself. I'm barely a student of Jesus. I'm barely learning and applying and trying to figure this following Jesus. How can I help other people? Where do I start? And this is why we said we start with those who we have greatest contact, greatest influence, greatest impact on right in our home. In fact, we said it this way. Our home is the primary place we make disciples. This is where it happens. So how do we, how do we leverage this influence, this impact, this opportunity we have to make disciples of our children our grandchildren our nieces our nephews the next generation with those that live in our house with us well we said we do it the Shema way now if you brought your Bibles you can start turning there you can turn your Bible on whatever you need to do to Deuteronomy chapter 6 Deuteronomy chapter 6 so this Deuteronomy is the last book of what's called the Torah or the law. We have Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and then Deuteronomy. So the fifth book of the Bible, but it's the last book of a section that followers of Jesus and any good Jew would know is the Torah. And so it's a repetition of the law. Deuteronomy, a second spoken version of the law. And so God used Moses, the prospect Moses, whom you've probably heard about before, to write out these things. And so in Deuteronomy chapter six, we see this passage of scriptures called the Shema. And Shema means simply to listen or to hear with an intent to obey. And we started off right here at the beginning of the Shema, beginning in verse six. This was last week. Hear, O Israel. In other words, listen up the people of God. The Lord, our God, the Lord is one. And then watch this. You shall love the Lord your God with your heart, with your soul, with your might, and all the things that I command you today shall be on your heart. We said the Shema starts with you first. Parents, if you ever hope to make disciples inside your house, it starts with your life and your relationship with Christ first. You've got to let that overflow. And this is a really, really good thing. Because last week said it's really, really good because faith training in your home primarily happens through modeling. You can teach your kids what you know, but you're going to reproduce who you are. They're watching you. Show them. You and I need to be examples of what it looks like to be a fearless follower of Jesus, to love the Lord God with all our heart, with all our mind, with all our soul, and with all our strength. So what are we modeling? We're modeling pursuit, not perfection. None of you are perfect. I'm not perfect. There's no perfect parent. The None of you are perfect. I'm not perfect. There's no perfect parent. The only one perfect ever in this world was Jesus Christ himself. Never sinned. But all of us are imperfect. So we're not modeling perfection. We're modeling what pursuit looks like. What it looks like to pursue Jesus. To love him with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength. What it looks like to, when you mess up, how do you respond? All these things. And so this is what we talked about last week. Now this week, I want to move to the next part of the Shema, the next verse. We're just going to focus on verse seven of Deuteronomy six. In the beginning, it says this, you shall teach them diligently to your children. Now, immediately when I read that right out of the gate, I think, okay, well then I guess modeling is not enough. Like modeling is important. You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your mind, and these commands should be on your heart. So modeling is vitally important in this process of discipling those in our homes, but apparently I have to be intentional. I have to be diligent in teaching my children. And this is a challenge because think about it. When it comes to training our children, almost in any area of life, what we do is we outsource training. Academically, right? We find the right tutors, the right teachers, the right school district, the right school, the right curriculum. We're looking to the experts to teach our kids chemistry and physics and sociology, all these different topics because we're like, man, I'm not the expert. I'll teach them what I know, but I'm going to outsource this athletically. I don't know how to play volleyball. So I'm going to find the right coach, the right team, the right, whatever it might be, even artistically. I don't know how to dance. So I'm going to find a dance school. I don't know how to, how to, how to paint. So I'm going to find somebody to teach them to paint. Like we, we outsource this. It can't be that way though with the heart. Moms and dads, you are positioned and you are called to be part of what God's plan is to shape your child's heart. Their faith. We can't outsource that thing. And so when I read this and I hear the pastor get all excited, even though it's me, I'm excited and I believe this. When I'm reading that, the first thing I think in my mind is, when? Come on, come on, be honest with me. When was the last day you had nothing on your family calendar? No work, no school, no homework, no practices, no games, no music lessons, no scouts, no chores, nothing on your calendar. I mean, mean come on let's just be honest this is crazy like if we just get the kids fed homework done and in bed before midnight boom it's a win right you show up to church and you're like and now i'm supposed to be the person who leads my kid to know and walk with christ like this is overwhelming and parents listen, listen. Even if you're not parents, listen to this and share this. God designed it this way, and he's made it very, very, very practical. This is why the Bible is so important to read as often as you can, because so much of Scripture reveals to us how to do this. And this is what Deuteronomy 6-7 does for us. It reveals to us the Shema way. It says, you shall teach them diligently to your children talk of them and watch this when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and and when you lie down and when you rise this naturally happens in your life in fact if if you're taking notes i want you to write this down there's only two things you need to do to highly apply and accurately apply this text. You need to be present and seize the opportunity. To be present, I'm not just saying just show up and sit in your house. Be mentally, emotionally, relationally, spiritually present in that moment. And then look for the, I wish I would have maybe changed this to opportunities. Because so many times God will provide an opportunity. Sometimes you're watching a TV show and boom, there's that awkward moment. Somebody said something, did something, whatever it is, and there's an opportunity. A teaching moment, diligently saying, you know what, my kids spend so many hours in my home. I'm going to be present and seize the opportunity. So here's what I want to do this morning. I want to look at Deuteronomy 6-7, and I want to just walk through there and say, okay, practically, practically, how do we be present and seize the opportunity when we sit in our house, when we walk by the way, when we lie down, and when we rise? And so I've asked someone to help me. My mentor, as a parenting mentor, one of my really good friends, and our family pastor, Pastor Lane Meek. So will you welcome by applause Lane Meek to the stage? Here we go. Come on, Lane. And what I want to do this morning is just kind of interview Lane a little bit, and we're going to get really, really practical. So if you brought your phones again, pull them out. We're just going to say, okay, what is this? Let's give a few examples of how this could look, how this could apply in your life as you're seeking to make disciples in your home. What does this look like? Now, Lane and I have known each other for about 12 years. And when I first met Lane, I actually met his sons before I met him. And my boys at the time were in middle school and elementary. And I watched the way Hayden and Mason lived their life. They weren't perfect, but these were two teenagers that were a little bit older, a little bit farther in life than my boys. And I watched how they lived their life. And I thought, huh, those guys are committed followers of Jesus. I would like my boys to be like that. So I decided, you know what? I'm going to go to the expert and not ask him to be the dad for my boys, but coach me. And so I got Lane a cup of coffee, and I think I paid, so you probably owe me, but that's okay, we'll talk about that later. And I just started asking questions. And Lane's like a parenting Yoda if you get him alone, because I would ask questions to him, and then he would ask a question back. He'd say, Chris, I know you're asking this question, but maybe you should be asking this question. And it was good to just have an outside voice in my life to challenge me. And there were times that I disagreed with what Lane said, and he would just gently and caring and patiently kind of redirect me and correct me. And it turns out, as Lane and I talked more, that he and his wife, Laura, have actually not only been parents for almost 30 years now, their oldest son will be 29 in October, I think, but they've been training parents for almost 25 years. And he was sharing with me some of the things that he has learned and he has taught. And so I got this crazy idea. I said, Lane, what if you come up and we start this church called Fearless Church and you come and you train parents? In fact, this might be embarrassing for Lane, but can you imagine your boss doing this? We're going to look at Lane's job description real quick. Here's his job description right here. This is why we pay Lane and what we expect from him to train our parents, step-parents, foster parents, grandparents, people that have this influence to be what? The primary faith trainers in the lives of their children. Not exclusive, not excluding what the church is called to do and should do, but to train, to equip the parents to be the primary faith trainers. And next week, I don't want you to miss next week, because next week for the first time, we're gonna publicly announce and share with you our parent training plan. We call it the flight plan. Pastor Lane's gonna come up here and he's gonna give you an overview and he's going to share with you, hey, here's how we plan to train our parents. And so don't miss next week, or if you do have to miss, watch online or watch later in the week. So let's dive in. You shall teach them. Wait, you were going to share with me a quick parent fail story, weren't you? Well, I forget about that. Actually, as your parenting mentor, I did want to affirm you in your previous guidance in teaching your kids that airsoft hurts yeah importance of firearms that's that's just good parenting I did the same thing but we use paintballs in our house. So it's good. So clearly you've got a couple of experts up here to talk. So as we look at this text, I went over to Lane's house on Tuesday afternoon and we were talking about this and Lane said, hey, before we dissect this and kind of talk about sitting in your house and by the way and lying down and when you rise up, he said, I want to point out something. So I want you to share with what you shared with me Tuesday afternoon when we were in your house. Right. So as we look at this, these look like just normal, common time frames. Do you notice some similarities there between each one of these? They're all during periods of non-conflict. It's really a proactive approach to training our kids, but we generally don't do that as parents, do we? We're generally more reactive, right? We get our discipline and our training done at the same time. You know, my grandmother used to say, I'm going to preach his funeral. That's a great way to get them to know it. If you don't believe me, think about the last time you guys had a moment of intense fellowship with your spouse. That's Christianese for fighting. So, when was the last time? That's Christianese for fighting. So when was the last time? And let's just assume that halfway through, you realize somehow Holy Spirit comes down and says, Lane, you're wrong here. Which didn't happen very often, but it did. It did. And let's say that my wife is trying to teach me something, trying to share something with me. How open do you think I am to that? We're in the throes of battle. I have not admitted defeat yet. Why do we expect our kids to be any different? And we react to a situation. I'm not saying we don't discipline our kids, but don't use that time to do your training. Find a period of non-conflict, and we're gonna talk about a few of those today. That's perfect. So let's just walk down. Let's start with the first thing. When you sit in your house, so remember, when you sit in your house, what are you going to do? You're going to be present and you're going to seize the opportunity. So again, think about it. You're going to spend, and your kids are going to spend more time in your house, more consistent time than any place else. So when you sit in your house, be present and seize the opportunity. So really, really practical. Give us an example of how we can do that. Okay, so lots of places in your house. Where is the place that most people gravitate towards? Even when you have company, where does everybody go? Everybody goes to the kitchen, right? Then a dining room table. So the table, that's a great place for you guys to have an impact on your kids and have an opportunity to teach them. One of the games that we played, we'll give you just a real quick, easy example. One of the games we played with our kids was best and worst. And it was basically, hey, what was the best part of your day? What was the worst part of your day? It was a great way to get conversation going. But moms and dads, we had to participate as well. Actually, we got to participate. Because if you're not allowing yourself to be vulnerable in front of your kids and share some of your best and worst, best and worst does not become a fun family event. It becomes an interrogation. So make sure that you are part of that. It was a great way for us to connect. You know, when the kids didn't want to play, you'd say, you know, what was your best, and what do y'all think they said the best? Recess or lunch. So don't accept those as answers. Make them go a little bit deeper. Best and worst is just a great way to connect with your kids. Yeah, and I asked Lane for permission. I'm going to make you not sound good right now, but I want you to share the story about the conversation you and Laura had about when you're sitting in your house, it's not just being a loaf, like sitting, but it's being present. So share that story you shared with me. Yeah. So this whole idea about being present, you know, I often tell people half of my counsel for parents are the places that I screwed up as a parent myself. And so this is one of those failures. I will tell you, as a lot of fathers, I struggled to connect with my boys sometimes. I struggled to engage. I'd come home from work. I've got a million things going on inside my head, and I had a hard time turning that off and making sure that I was present at home. And my beautiful bride was so much wiser than me, and she was trying to encourage me. Hey, Lane, you've got to be present. And she told me this for years, and I didn't understand it. Like, I am present. I'm right here. If they need me, they'll come see me. I was busy watching TV or I would say reading a book, but you guys would all know I'm lying. But I had a hard time being present. And I remember one time my oldest boy comes in. It was late at night. And man, Holy Spirit was just kind of like tapping me on the shoulder saying, hey, hey, be present. Seize the opportunity. I'm like, oh, okay. All right. So I hop up out of my chair. I run into the kitchen. Hayden's just in there. He's just milling around. Nothing's going on. Something's going on in his head, but he's really not doing anything. So I just go in and I sit down at the island. And we just kind of hem-haw around a little bit. And then slowly, sure, we just started talking. I wasn't trying to impart some great biblical wisdom on him. We just started talking. And just that little tool of being present allowed the door to open up for us to talk about more spiritual matters. And I'll remember that day the rest of my life. It wasn't anything huge, but it was a turning point for me. Something as simple as being present leads to opportunities to speak biblical truth to your kids. That's exactly right. Like, moms, dads, you can do this. The author of Deuteronomy, again, Moses, he knows this. Watch what he what he says he says it's not only when you sit in your house which is going to be part of your daily routine but when you're on the go when you walk by the way when you're journeying from point a to b so lane give us another real practical example how can i be present how can i seize the opportunity when i'm on the way well on the way probably the when I'm on the way? Well, on the way, probably the most common place would be in your car, right? You're never going to have a more captive audience than in your car. And there are lots of hours that we spend with our kids in the car. I'll tell you, this is another early on in my parenting career. I just did really horrible in this way because of the way I was brought up. So that way I was brought up, my dad said, kids are to be seen and not heard. That's right. That means keep your butt in the back seat. Y'all better entertain yourself and keep quiet or I'm coming over the back. That's the way I grew up. So what do you think I brought into my family? That's the way I grew up. So what do you think I brought into my family? I may not have been quite so harsh, but since I did not have it modeled for me as Chris was talking about earlier, I didn't know what to say. So I was trained, I was governed to be quiet and get down the road as fast as can, stop as few times as possible and if the boys wet their pants, that's on them. Literally. Yeah. So I would love to be able to, guys, to give you counsel in this area, but this is an area where I struggled in. I did get better as the kids got older. Chris, tell me how you leveraged that time. Yeah, like I call it a heart checkup. So I don't have some list at my house of here's all the things I'm going to teach my boys. Instead, a lot of what I do is very similar as a pastor is I have these conversations. What's going on? What are you thinking about? What are you feeling? what are your life experiences it's like I'm heart checkups and really I wrote on here like the what and the why so I remember when I boys were literal what are you thinking one time we're heading to school and Christians looking out the window and I'm like oh man he must be thinking about the majesty of God what are you thinking about Christian he's like candy it's so good candy and I'm like dude he's right candy is good why do you think candy's good? And I engaged that conversation. It's not always these spiritual aha moments But I remember another time. What are you thinking? Well, I'm I'm I'm thinking that I'm a little scared today. Whoa So I'm hearing that and and what do you think I'm gonna ask? Why are you scared and he proceeds to tell me about our relationship with this kid on the playground? That's a bully right and it's in that moment and parents you don't have to have the quick answer don't front in this you can literally answer hey thanks for sharing and then that's when you retreat and pull back okay as fearless followers of jesus how do we deal with bullies because the reality is it's not just bullies in middle school or in elementary right bullies happen our entire life so as fearless followers of jesus that's a teachable moment. And even if I don't know what to say in that moment, I know what and why I know what's going on in his heart, which allows me to prepare, allow me to trust the spirit of God, the word of God, even the people of God to say, okay, how do I help my kid in this? So it's this heart checkup that you can do just asking, Hey, what are you thinking? What are you feeling? Why are you thinking that? Why are you feeling that? And so that's the simple thing that I would do. So let's continue on. So he goes on and he says, not only when you're in your house, but when you walk by the way, again, think about this. It's so practical, daily routine of life, when you lie down. So Lane, how do we be present and seize the opportunity at, let's just, Time is one of the best opportunities to reach your kids. And you all know why. Because they don't want to what? They don't want to go to bed. They don't want to go to bed. So any excuse they can have to stay up, even if it means talking to mom and dad, you're golden. You're golden. And here's what's really special about this. Even when they're young, we all tend to have three parts of our lives. We have a public life, we have a personal life, and we have a private life. And it doesn't matter how old you are, each one of us have all three of those lives. But what's interesting about our private life, one can only gain access to that by invitation only. I don't care how macho a dad you are or in control mom you are, you don't gain access to anyone's private life outside of their invitation. And at bedtime is the best time to find those invitations. We have something that we call that open window phenomenon. You know those times whenever your kids start to open up a little bit and they share something special from within their heart? Be looking for that, parents. Moms, Dad, be looking for those open window moments. And when you get invited in, tread carefully. Tread carefully. Now is not the time to rearrange the furniture. Now is the time to listen and to encourage. And your little, you know, first grade daughters, you know, says, you know, Daddy, Daddy, do you think I'm pretty? Well, of course, sweetheart. Of course, I think you're pretty. Why would you, why would you ask? Well, Billy on the playground said I was\u2026 Wait a second, who's Billy? Yeah. Yeah, guys, now's not the time to, who's Billy, your first grade daughter? And what are you doing talking to boys to begin with? Oh, no, sweetheart, of course I think you're pretty. You know who else thinks you're pretty? Jesus thinks you're pretty. Jesus looks at your heart. Do you see how we can turn some of these conversations without going in on the attack? Now's not the time to rearrange the furniture when you've been invited into someone's private world. Be respectful and be cautious. Oh, that's good. So when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and finally, he says when you rise. And I asked Lane if I could share something with y'all. We could talk about maybe a little practical thing, but let me tell you how I apply that in my life. To be totally honest with you, one of my goals, I really want to be a good father, but I struggle with it. Like I'm selfish. I don't, I'm not present. I'm not seizing the opportunity. Like a message like this is really good for me because I have to prepare it and then communicate it. And I'm really just preaching to myself, but I want to be a good father. And so many times I fall asleep and I think I wasn't present. I missed the opportunity. Why did I say that? Why didn't I do that? And I feel like a failure. But yet when I read, when you rise up, think about when you rise up. When is that? That's in the morning. That's when the sun comes up. That's when you start a new day. His mercies are new every day. And it reminds me, moms, dads, yes, yes. Be present and seize the opportunity, but in those days that you don't, in those days that you mess up, rise up the next day and have a restart. A restart where you say, you know what? I'm committed, I'm not gonna give up on this thing. I can do this thing. I might've messed up yesterday. I might've messed up the previous 14 years, but I can jump in where we are today and I can start to engage my kids in the natural course of life. Take on this role as it's trust the spirit of God, read the word of God to prepare yourself, trust God to use you and, and, and try again, try again, try again, jump in and say, you know what? I didn't do great yesterday. And I want to encourage you in this too. Some of you right now, you're in a point in parenting that's really, really difficult. A lot of times it's in this adolescent years or early adult years. Your child's becoming more independent, making choices that you wouldn't make. Maybe choices that are harmful to themselves and others. You're trying to step in and there's all this tension and you just want to give up. And one of my other parenting mentors, Charlie Gallagher, he said this. He said, Chris, calm down, dude. You don't even get your report card how you did as a parent until your kids are at least in their thirties. Thank you, God, for using Charlie to say that. Because there are those moments. Some of you right now, you're like, that's your biggest takeaway. You're like, he's only 28. Praise God. I'll find out in about a decade whether I did it again. Right? Don't give up. In fact, the Apostle Paul says this. Don't grow weary in doing good. Don't grow weary in this task of saying, I want to make disciples underneath my roof. Instead, in due season, we'll reap if we do not give up. If you fail, no, no, no. Maybe I should say it this way. When you fail, try again. Well No, no, no, maybe I should say it this way. When you fail, try again. Well, I'll tell you, Chris, we're not the only ones that need to hit reset. Guys, we need to allow our kids to hit reset. We need to model that for them of what it looks like to start over, to get a fresh shot. One of the lessons that Laura and I learned from her brother, actually, we were at home for Christmas one time, and one of their daughters had messed up, and he had her in the back room and, you know, taking care of business, whatever it was that they had to take care of. But one of the last things that he taught his child before they left the room, and it's something I took with me ever since, was he looked her square in the eye and he goes, okay, sweetheart, would you like to go try again? Parents, how many times do we give our kids the opportunity to try again, to make it right? Or is it we just have a discipline and we leave them hanging? God tells us, would you like to try again? Look at the Israelites, how many times he gave them to try again. Give that same benefit to your kids. That's perfect. So moms and dads, remember, today we're going to walk out of here and're gonna say okay I get a restart I get a redo when you rise up in the morning I'm gonna be present mentally emotionally spiritually like I'm gonna recognize this and I'm gonna seize the opportunity or opportunities God gives me so Lane where do we start we talked about these three things it could be overwhelming I do not recommend you do all these you'll freak your kids out tonight you. You're like, hey, we're in the car. What do you feel, right? And they're like, ah, I just want chicken nuggets. Like, calm down. Where do we start in this thing? Well, I love one of my buddies, Rob Kiefer. We talk a lot about parenting. We've got our parenting class we meet on Thursday nights. And we give a lot of different specific tools that our parents can take away. But sometimes we'll look at these things and parents will say, I can't do that. I'm not wired that way. Or I can't do this over here. Do something. Pick one of these. Again, just as Chris said, don't do all threes. If you do all three of these, likely chances you're going to fail. You're going to become overwhelmed, and then you're going to respond in a probably non-Christian way to your kids. Pick one of these, and oftentimes, because we know our kids are different, you may have to choose a different pattern depending on the child. So which one works for which child? Pick one and do one. Perfect. Perfect. This calling to go make disciples of all peoples, including the little people in our lives, it is clear from Scripture, overwhelmingly clear, but moms and dads, it doesn't have to be overwhelming. Look, look, listen to this. I want you to imagine, think beyond today. Think 20, 30 years from now, you have your grandkids over at your house around your dinner table and it's dinner time. And all of a sudden your granddaughter pops up and she says, let's play best and worst. And you start to smile. And you say, where did you learn that? And she said, I learned it from my mom and my daddy. And so you start to share. But because you've been modeling for your own kids, now you can model for your grandkids. And you share and you say, you know what? Papa's worst is I went to the doctor today. And the doctor said, there's some numbers that are off with my blood sugar and and I've got to have more tests, and Papa's a little scared. And all of a sudden, your granddaughter pops up from her chairs and says, Papa, let me pray for you right now. And she puts her hand on your back, and this little eight-year-old little girl all of a sudden begins to pray the most sweetest faith-filled prayer you've ever heard. And tears begin to roll down your cheeks, and you ask her, you say, baby girl, where did you learn to pray like that? And she looks at you and says, from my mama and my daddy. And in that moment, you remember where they learned it from. They may have learned a few things at church, but they learned when life gets tough, they call it to the Father. They saw it in you. They experienced it in your house. Moms and dads, this is not a call to simply make disciples of our kids it's a call to make disciples who make disciples who make disciples your kids your grandkids your great-grandkids generational faithfulness for the glory of god this is something you can do when you sit in your house when you walk by the way when you down, and when you rise up again. Let's be present and let's seize the opportunity. Lane, I'm going to ask you, if you would, pray for our moms and dads, our step-parents, our foster parents. And just pray. This task, it's still, even though we tried to get real practical, it's still overwhelming. So would you mind praying for us right now? You bet. You bet. Let's pray. Father God, we come before you this morning, and I know that a message like this can be very disconcerting to certain people. There are probably people out there that maybe grew up in a home where it wasn't modeled right. out there that maybe grew up in a home where it wasn't modeled right. And they're saying, man, I don't even know how to do this. I don't have a plan. I don't have an example. Father, you left your Holy Spirit. You left your Word here for us to turn to as the greatest parenting book that was ever written father reveal yourself to us through your word father I pray for grandparents specifically right now is there are many of them out there that are raising their grandchildren and if they're not raising their grandchildren they live close enough that they get to be a second voice to their grandchildren. And God, I pray that they not just toss that responsibility aside, that they realize they have a part to play. Father, I know we have foster parents, we have regular parents, we have single parents, we have step-parents. Father, give them the courage just to take the first step. That's always the hardest one to take. Do something. Give them the courage to do something, to teach it to their children diligently it's in christ and we pray amen amen"}]}

And now, as we turn our attention again back to our teaching series, Fresh Start, grab a fresh cup of coffee, grab your Bible, open up your app, grab a pen, whatever it is you need to prepare yourself to hear what God wants to say to you this morning. to prepare yourself to hear what God wants to say to you this morning. Well, good morning. We are in a new series called Fresh Start. Last week we started the series, and if you missed Chris's message last week, it was a great message, specifically the first five to ten minutes when he was talking about the Nintendo. It was so great as he was talking about his frustrations with his parents, I remember that specifically. But see, it inspired me. It inspired me to share with you my Nintendo story. You see, I too wanted this Nintendo. I wanted to connect with my friends in a meaningful way, right? Like I wanted to share experiences with people. I could only honestly beat my parents so many times at Pac-Man on the Atari that I think my dad actually decided to get a Nintendo because he was tired of being beaten. I can't say that for sure. But unlike Chris's parents, my parents were good parents. Because my dad told me, hey, tonight I'm going to bring home a Nintendo. And me and my brother got so excited waiting for him to bring home this new Nintendo action set that I remember him walking in. I remember him coming down and putting the box in front of us. And then I saw this. Now, if you don't know what this is, I don't blame you. See, this was the Nintendo Deluxe set. The Deluxe set came with Rob. Rob was the robotic operating buddy. You see, he played the game with you, but Rob was just slow. He was so slow. Pretty soon he ended up on the shelf, and your little brother just would press A and B on the games that he was required to have Rob with. You see, on the back of the Deluxe set kind of shows you what came with it. So Rob had all of these contraptions that you had to hook up and put one of these controllers in to be able to play two players on a game by yourself. You see, it came with the gun, the console, and Duck Hunt. But what it did not come with? Super Mario Brothers. Yeah, you should be disappointed. You see, I too have to confess that to this day I have not beaten Super Mario Brothers, but it's not because I couldn't, like Chris, it's because I didn't have the chance to, right? So I don't know what happened, but a resentment started happening either towards my dad for buying the Deluxe set or Nintendo for making the deluxe set. But by 1988, that was destroyed when Konami released Contra. You see, Contra was my game. Contra was the game I enjoyed playing. You'd push start and you'd come down from a helicopter and drop into this jungle looking environment and you were Rambo. Like, you literally got to play Rambo, and you would shoot at these little boxes to upgrade your guns, go spray gun. It was the best gun on there, and you can see me afterwards to argue. But this was so good. You'd go through eight levels. You had three guys, two continues, and you had to get to the end of the game, which, for some reason reason was really weird. By the time you got there, you had a heart that beat real fast and pretty soon it exploded. And that's how you beat the game. All these aliens, I don't know. It was still fun. I enjoyed playing Contra. Up here, you see these little medals. That was your lives. You got three lives again, two continues to beat this game. And I was able to do that with what Konami actually gave us to do. And I loved playing Contra. But what I loved more about video games, or even Contra itself, was playing with people. Like it was a shared experience. We get to accomplish the same goal. We get to work on the same thing. And I loved playing video games with my friends, unless you were Sean. If Sean came over, he wanted to play Contra. He didn't have Contra. So as a team, you would start off and you'd each have three lives. And Konami, for some reason, you signed up for a brotherhood when you're getting into this game. And when your friend lost all their lives, Konami would say, well, you're a team, and he can press A, and he takes one of yours. I did not sign up for that. Like, I wanted to play this game and beat it, but John couldn't. So pretty soon, I just saw my lives ticking away, and I could only make one mistake. And when I made that mistake, you started all over at the beginning of the level. And then you're like, oh, this is so frustrating. So conflict started happening, right? Like I want to beat this goal, but Sean can't do it. So in order to salvage my relationship and beat the goal, I had to learn to do something different. You see, Konami was so brilliant. They blessed me with a possibility, okay? Konami built this code into their games, and this is the only contribution that I have to this Fresh Start series, is the Konami code here. You see, if you could put in up, down down left right left right be a start you would get 30 men ok so you can play contra with 30 men and the thing is is in order to do something different with your friends this would come across the screen and land here and you had to put this code in right you got to start when it starts coming across the screen and instead of just hitting start you had to hit select because Because if you don't hit select, he's not playing. If you hit select, then you go to two players, you hit start, and you both get 30 men. And we accomplished our goal. Like, it was so fun experiencing that shared experience with Sean as long as he had 30 men, right? And didn't take all of mine. And we accomplished this goal together. And that was a great, like, memory that was burned into my brain, but also the frustrations, right? And the difficulties were burned into my brain. And today, we're going to talk about just a fresh start with others. And when I say that, I don't know what you feel about others. I don't know what you feel about people sitting in this room. I don't know what you feel about people at home. In fact, relationships are really, really difficult, and if we're not careful, we can destroy those, right? We can destroy other people with our words, with our emotions. If we're not learning how to love, then we can destroy relationships. In fact, in life, relationships can kind of make you feel a certain way. Maybe today you come in here and you feel unloved. Or maybe you felt unloved before in life. Maybe you feel cheated on or dishonored or less than by someone. Maybe you feel at war with somebody right now. you feel torn down by somebody made fun of rejected I don't know maybe you feel like no one cares in life like nobody in your in your circles in your relationships actually care maybe you were just tired of spending emotional energy mental energy on somebody maybe you're just tired of giving in general. Like you're a parent and you're like, when is it my turn? Right? Maybe you feel the weight of the world of your relationships on your shoulders. Maybe it feels only up to you. Maybe you feel unforgiven or maybe hurried. Hurried could be a good thing in our, like it's not a good thing. Like, right? I've got six kids. Our schedules are everywhere. We're always feeling busy. Maybe you feel lied to. Maybe you just feel like people in general are unkind. Maybe you feel talked down to. Worse, you feel pushed down. Maybe when you're pushed down, you feel stepped on and may feel like you're beneath somebody. Maybe you feel unknown in relationships, maybe discouraged, judged, devoured, destroyed, or provoked. You see, we feel these things in relationships, and sometimes that's all we know how to do things. The interesting thing is I looked at Scripture, and everything that Scripture says we should do, I just said the opposite. And now it's kind of weighty. Like, when we think about feeling these things, what do we do with that? You see, relationships do matter. And sometimes when we feel these things, what do we do? We isolate. We break relationships. We get divorced. We end the discussion. We disown children. We disown parents. Like, when we start feeling these things with people, we sever relationships. It's what the world does. It's what the world tells us to do. And so sometimes we will tell ourselves, hey, I'm going to sever. I'm going to pull away from relationships. I'm going to focus on my relationship with God. That's a good thing. Like we're at church, we're talking about a relationship with God is a very good thing to invest in. Like I want to read my Bible more. I want to pray more. I want to spend more time with God in the morning. I want to read my Bible more, I want to pray more, I want to spend more time with God in the morning, I want to listen to podcasts more, I want to listen to more messages, I just want to learn more about God. And that is a great thing to invest in, to put your time in. And Jesus would even agree with you. You see, Jesus is talking to a group of people, and he's teaching them, he's showing them what we're supposed to do as humans. And in this group are our Pharisees, the religious leaders of the day. And they really read their Bible a lot. In fact, they memorized Scripture. They memorized the first five books of our Bible, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. We can't even read through all of those, right? You get to Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. We can't even read through all of those, right? You get to Leviticus, you just stop. I know what you do. Like they memorized all of those. They prayed for people. They prayed out loud for people. They went to temple almost every day, made sacrifices. They taught people. They knew a lot about God. And Jesus was sitting in this crowd, and one of them decided to speak up and say, Jesus, what's one of the things, like what's the most important thing for us to do? Like what is the greatest commandment that you would tell us that needs to happen? And Jesus says, man, I agree with you. Like you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and all your strength. And as a follower of Jesus, that's what I hope we're doing as a church. That's what I hope to do with who I am, is follow him with all of me. And then Jesus does something else. Jesus always does that one thing else. And he says the second is equally important. Love your neighbor as yourself. So who's our neighbor? It's basically anyone not sitting in your seat today. Okay? That's who we're called to love. That's who we're told to love. And it's so important. Jesus elevates it to that of equal to loving God. Like, have we ever really felt the weight of that, those two words, equally important? Like, it is so important to love others that it's on equal standing with loving God. And as we talk about that, John, one of the disciples in his book says, you can't actually say that you love God and hate your brother. You can't actually say you love God and just like your brother. Like he says, our love for God pours out in the way that we love each other. And so I have to ask you, like if this is so important to Jesus, and sometimes we get relationships wrong and we sever and we push and we isolate, how can we actually love one another if we don't have an other in our lives? if we don't have an other in our lives? How can we actually do what God has asked us to do if we're not in relationships with other believers? And he actually calls it a little, like he levels up the playing field. He says, I'm gonna actually raise the bar here. In fact, I want you to love each other. And he says this, and now I'm giving you a new commandment. Love each other. Well, that's not new. We just heard that, right? He says, but don't love others as you would yourself. Love them just as I have loved you. He says, the reason why I honestly believe, the reason why we get relationships wrong is we try to love the way we wanna be loved. We try to love in the way that we know or we're taught by our parents to love. And Jesus says, that's not the best way. Jesus says, in order to truly love others, love other believers, we've got to learn to love as Jesus loved. So how did he do that? Well, first, in 1 John, John literally says, hey, we love, we learn how to love because he first loved us. And so you don't even honestly know how to love well. I don't know how to love well. We only know how to love based off of how we experience Jesus' love. So the very first thing he says is we love God not because we love God first. No, most of us in this room would agree. I never actually loved God first. I was only drawn into a relationship with him by understanding his love, by feeling his love, by being drawn by the Spirit. Or we don't actually know how to love others because honestly, we're not that lovable, right? Let's just be honest with each other and just honestly all say, I am not that lovable. Okay, I'm not gonna make you say that. But here's the thing. Jesus didn't wait for us to become lovable. He didn't wait for us to become good. He didn't wait for us to live up to a mark. He actually left heaven and pursued us. He pursued you. He pursued me. He went first. And in fact, when you look at his ministry on earth, the disciples weren't flocking to him going, I want to follow you. He pursued them and said, follow me, come and follow me. He went first. He was also very committed. Oh, sorry. This was the next slide. Like he went first. Okay. You got that. He was also very committed. Oh, sorry, this was the next slide. Like, he went first, okay? You got that. He was also very committed. You see, I don't know if you've ever experienced this in life, but Jesus experienced a group of people, his disciples, that would betray him, that denied him, that questioned him, that actually scattered and left him when he was in need. They just doubted him altogether. And Jesus stayed. Jesus stayed with them for three years, experiencing those negative things with them. And he's committed to you and me. Like the Bible says, even to being obedient to death on a cross, committed to death on a cross, devoted to death on a cross, he did that so that you and I could have a relationship with him. You see, Jesus is also real. There's a story in the Bible where he is just feeling the weight of what he's supposed to do, and that is to go to the cross. And he doesn't want to. He's wrestling with it. He doesn't want to do what God's asked him to do. And so he goes first, and he goes to Peter, James, and John and says, hey, come with me to the garden and pray with me. My heart is troubled. And he sits there, and he goes off just a little ways from them, and he starts to pray, and he comes back, and they're asleep. They're asleep, and he wakes them up. Hey, hey, just can't you pray for an hour? Just pray with me. My heart is troubled. And he goes back to pray again. And he comes back in there asleep again. Okay, at this point, I'll be honest with you. If I'm in that much need and I have friends that are sleeping, I'm saying, peace out. I'm going to go sleep. I'm going to go lay down. I'm not going to be as committed because they weren't committed to me. And Jesus steps in and he just, he wakes them up again and says, hey, my time has come. And he goes to the cross, but he was real with them. He's like, my heart is troubled. I ache. I hurt. I need your prayers. He goes first. He does all of these things. And I know you of these things. And I know you need these things. I know you need these things because I need these things. I need people in my life. I need people to teach me, to talk to me, to do all of these things to help me grow in Christ. You see, here at Fearless, we believe that not only does God speak through his word and his spirit, but he speaks through his people. He works through his people. And yes, we get that wrong sometimes because we're human, but God continues to work through people. And you see, you were created to have relationships. Some of you I know are arguing in your head right now. I was not created for that. Okay. So there's a book called The Other Half of Church that I've read in the past. And I just want to, it talks about brain science and how we were created. Well, I'm assuming you have a full brain, right? Like I know you probably question some of your children's, but we were all created with a full brain. And it goes on to talk as we develop, as we are part of our lives here and we're growing, the left side of our brain is what commonly, is what we commonly think of the mind in popular culture. Our concept of the mind describes actually only half of our brain. So if I said, hey, use your mind, whatever thought comes to your head, that's only half of your brain, okay? So the left brain is dominant for logical thinking, problem-solving strategies, and language. Problems are solved, plans are hatched, arguments are formulated, problem solving strategies, and language. Problems are solved. Plans are hatched. Arguments are formulated. Stories are told. Truth is defended. That's what you're experiencing right now. Like, we're here telling people what we believe is truth, and you're here processing these things. Do I agree with it or not? Like, do I believe that this is truth in my life? Stories are told. You're connecting with people. You're telling yourself stories from your past saying this doesn't line up or this does line up. Arguments are formulated. I don't agree with that or I do agree with that. Plans are hatched. Okay, if I do agree with that, what do I need to do different? What do I need to do now? And problems are solved. Here's what I need to do. Like you're processing this as you're hearing these ideas, as you're hearing truth, but this isn't only what God wants you to do. This is how Western culture has built church. To come and hear a message and then leave and go about your day, your week, and then come back again. And we want you to be a part of that. We want you to be challenged, but that's not it. If this is all you're experiencing, you're only experiencing part of God's plan for you, for me. You're experiencing truth. You're experiencing ideas. You're experiencing God speaking through his word. But you see our right side of our brain, our right side of our brain, it integrates our life, including our connection to loved ones, our bodies, our surroundings, our emotions, our identities, and our community. Character formation flows out of these connections. The right brain processes these questions, who's happy to see me here? What do I feel right now? Is there anyone here who understands me? How do I act like myself right now? What do my people, my community do in this situation? You see, our right brain depends on relational input to form our character. Keeping our relational right brain running smoothly creates the optimum environment for character transformation. You see, what you're doing is if you don't have others in your life, you're hearing truth but not building character. That's why a lot of times when we just leave here, we don't put things into practice because we don't have somebody to process with. We don't have somebody to talk about. We don't have somebody to agree with us or not agree with us. We don't have a way for God to work through his people, through relationships, to transform me. We need relationships. We're wired for that. We're created for that. And Jesus says it's important. It's just as important as loving God is to love others. But we've got to love like Jesus. You see, if we love like Jesus, this is what the Bible says we should experience in community. We should experience with relationships. You see, these are set up as rows, and we want you to get into circles. We want you to, in circles, processing things, talking about things that may look like a family unit, that may look like a husband and wife, that may look like a community group or friends at work. We want you to process this stuff because in circles, biblical community, in ways that we connect in relationships, we get to love one another 16 times in John that's commanded to do. We get to be devoted to one another, honor one another, live at peace with one another, build up one another, be like-minded with one another, accept one another, greet one another. We get to admonish one another. We get to care for one another, greet one another. We get to admonish one another. We get to care for one another, serve one another. We get to bear each other's burdens. We get to forgive one another. We get to be patient with one another. We get to be kind with one another, consider others in our group better than ourselves. We get to look out the interest of others that we're in relationships with. We get to not only bear with their burdens, but bear with one another. We get to teach one another, comfort one another, encourage one another, exhort one another, stir up one another, not to anger, but to love and good works. We get to show hospitality to one another. We get to use the gifts God created in us to benefit one another. We get to be humble with one another. We get to pray for one another, confess your sins to one another. You get to, well, one another. We get to pray for one another, confess your sins to one another. You get to, well, you don't get to not, well, you, okay, you get to tell truth, right? I mean, I was on a roll there, and it just kind of stopped me. We get to experience not lying to one another, not passing judgment on one another, not slandering one another, not grumbling against each other. This is the community I want. This is the community I need. You know why? Because life is difficult. And the way that life tells us to do relationships, man, it just hurts more. And we need each other, and we need to love each other, but not how I love. We need to love how Jesus loved. And so when it comes to actually a fresh start with others, and I don't know where that is for you today, we've got to learn to go first. We've got to learn to pursue. Jesus pursued us. We should pursue others. We get to be committed, not have to be committed. We get to be real. We get to share our frustrations. We get to share our committed. We get to be real. We get to share our frustrations. We get to share our questions. We get to process those things with each other. We get to have a fresh start with others. God uses his people to give us a fresh start. And so here at Fearless, I don't know what your next step is, but here at Fearless, I'm gonna walk through how you can get into circles. Two different ways that we do this. If you go to our website, and you say, it's time for a fresh start, you get to hit learn more, right? So if you hit learn more, you get to come up, hello Konami code, right? Fresh start, and you get down here, get connected. You're gonna also see be trained environments and be trained events. You see Fearless High School. This is a way for people in high school to come and experience truth and get in circles so that we see character transformation by walking through life with other believers. You see re-engaged in all this stuff. I'm gonna talk about that in a minute. You see be trained events. So these environments and events, that's one way, even though there's two, that's one way, it's kind of like the Trinity, right? So it's one way that we experience circles here at Fearless. And I'm gonna come down here to this Fearless Woman Camp real quick. So Fearless Woman are, are, man, that was great. So events and environments are seasonal. It's seasonal. Like you make it go to this or you may not it's okay you see this be challenged this be challenged environment is actually we want you here all the time to connect to think and to process and to hear what's going on these seasonal things that's if you need it so guys I'm gonna walk through this real quick. Events and environments, they're specialized, seasonal, and strategic. So we target specific people in areas. So guys, I'm going to do a pop quiz on you real quick. Do you register for woman camp? A little worried about that one, not going to lie. Great answer. It's for women only, okay? So don't register for women camp if you're a guy, okay? It's offered at different times. It's seasonal. It comes up once a month, okay? We want you to get in. If you can't, it's okay. You're not pressured to do so. It's wherever you can connect. It's designed to help you grow in understanding, truth, information, use your left side of the brain, and you're gonna get into circles. You're gonna meet people, and you're going to process what you learn together. So hopefully character transformation starts. In our environments, we do this for here at the church, but it's longer term. Events are short term. Environments are longer term so re-engage it's for married people if you're not married don't sign up for re-engage it's not your place okay so you get to sign up for 16 weeks and what you're going to do is you're going to have a curriculum you're going to be able to go through this curriculum as individuals and as a couple and then you're going to come and hear teaching and a story for about 20 minutes. Teaching or a story for 20 minutes. And then you're going to get into circles for an hour and a half. And you're going to process what you've been learning, truth that God's told you, and how to process that with other believers and experience character transformation. Because you're using your left and right side of your brain. For parenting toddlers, if you are a parent with toddlers, you need this. You want to know why I know that? You're living life on the edge right now. You don't know what's going on with life. You think it's ending tomorrow. And I can understand. Toddlers don't have logic. They don't have, well, they got their own emotions and you have no idea where they are. There, little Johnny's hanging from the fan with a Nerf gun in his diaper. And I don't know how that got there. Like that's what you're experiencing. And you need to sign up because you're gonna hear some information and you're going to be able to then process it in groups and you're going to realize I'm not alone. I don't have just the toddler that's hanging from the fan. You've got one that's doing something completely different and I actually would rather have the toddler from the fan, right? But you need to sign up. It's 16 weeks. The porch. I knew I'd get one. This is for young adults, okay? This is, if you're 20 to 30, this is for you. Sign up and register for the 23rd. We've never done this before, so we want to launch this and launch it well. What you're going to do is you're going to come to an info note. You're going to hear that for 16 weeks, you're going to come and hear a message that's geared towards young adults. And what are you going to do? You're going to process it in circles. Are you getting the process here? Are you getting the pattern? And you're going to build relationships that help form character. Foundation groups, if you've been married three years or less, you can register for this one. This is a little longer term, so we have an info meeting to let you know what's going on. You will be in the circles with a mentor couple meeting in homes, and you're going to walk nine to ten months with that mentor and other couples that have been married three years or less. And you're going to talk about married things. And you're going to process that together, and you're gonna learn to grow in relationships together, and you're going to have character transformation because of it. You see, that's how we do our be trained environments and events. And if none of that fits for you, our second way of doing things here is our community groups. We want you to be here on Sunday processing what, or listening to what God is teaching us and moving us towards. We want you to seasonally get into these things that we have here for Be Trained, but we always want you to experience biblical community. And so what you can do is you can get into circles. These groups meet off-site at at homes, in a family setting, where you get to process the message or a study or something else. Going through that together with believers, and you're processing and you're growing at the same time. You see, community is a small group of people committed to being in authentic, intentional relationships with each other, to grow in their love for God. Love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and streak yet we want to do it together we want to love each other and their neighbors we essentially do life together and so if you need to find community and be trained is not for you and your next step is to have a fresh start with others and you feel like this is it you need to register for exploring community it's next week at 11 o'clock, this service. It will be next week, and you can find out what your next steps to get into community groups are. But I don't, again, I don't know where you are. I don't know where God has you next, but I know that God just doesn't want you to start a fresh start with Him. He wants you to start a fresh start with others as well so whether that's your marriage and you just need a fresh start and be really working on your marriage or maybe that's your parenting or or actually loving your parents we need that too right from our kids or it's one of these be trained environments or community or maybe it's a fresh start with relationships at work i don't know know what it is, but I do know, I do know that if you are ready to take a fresh start with your relationships, you've got to go first. In your marriage, you need to go first to have a fresh start. In your parenting, you need to go first. If your children, you need to go first. If you're children, you need to go first. Connect. You need to connect with God so that you can connect with others. You need to go first. You need to be committed. Man, marriage is hard. It's okay. You need to be committed. Parenting is hard. It's okay. You can't disown your kids. You need to be committed. If you get into these be trained environments, commit, like literally commit for 16 weeks to do the work and commit to sharing what God's having you go through. Be real. If you get into community, commit, like decide to do what they're doing and show up. Make the night important. Don't schedule other things. Connect with people and be real. You gotta be real. If you hide, people don't know how to love you well. People don't know how to suggest what to do. People can't process if we hide. God wants to work through his word, through his spirit, and through his people. And today, what's your fresh start? Let's pray. Father, I do thank you for your people. God, I'm thankful for your word and how it leads us to your people. God, I am thankful for the people in my life that challenge me, that push me, that help me look more like you. God, you created us to not just need you, but to need others. I pray as we come before you to, yes, grow and transform our heart through your spirit and through your word, but allow us to step into circles, find people that will allow, that will transform us, that will use your word and speak through your spirit. And God, help us do that together. God, I'm thankful, as always, for this time and for your people and the people that are in my life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI sermon writer training on the Sunday service transcripts from Fearless Church in Centerville, Ohio."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a sermon in the style of Chris Williams. Draw inspiration from the themes of commitment, humility, generosity, and responding to God's invitation in the Gospel of Luke. Begin by discussing the importance of investigating the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, specifically focusing on His kingdom teachings. Emphasize the idea that following Jesus means becoming a kingdom citizen and living differently on this planet. Encourage the congregation to attend an upcoming event, such as a celebration or baptism, as a way to connect with others and meet the people who make up the church.\n\nNext, delve into the concept of God's rules blessing people rather than oppressing them. Use the story of Jesus healing a man on the Sabbath to illustrate this point. Challenge the congregation to consider whether they truly believe that God's law is based on love, not control.\n\nThen, discuss the importance of choosing humility over being honored. Share Jesus' advice about taking the lowest place at the table and explain that this principle applies to all relationships. Encourage the congregation to seek honor from God rather than trying to exalt themselves.\n\nAfter that, talk about the true meaning of generosity. Use Jesus' teaching about inviting the poor, crippled, lame, and blind to a banquet to illustrate that generosity is an act of sacrifice, not exchange. Remind the congregation that Jesus' generosity towards us is the ultimate example of this principle.\n\nFinally, emphasize the importance of responding to God's invitation to follow Him. Share the parable of the great feast and explain that there is always room in the kingdom of God for those who respond in faith. Encourage the congregation to make a commitment to follow Jesus and to share His message with others.\n\nEnd the sermon by leading the congregation in a song of worship, such as \"Worthy is the Lamb.\" Remind them that God is worthy of our praise and adoration, and that He desires a genuine relationship with us. Encourage them to respond to His invitation with faith and commitment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, today is a big day in the life of our church family. About six months ago, we made a commitment to investigate the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, according to the Gospel of Luke. And we've bounced all around. In fact, this is the first three months in a message series entitled More Than a Man. And the goal in that series, some of y'all that were around here probably remember that. If not, just kind of catch you up. We were looking at the person in the work of Jesus. Who is he? What did he do? Why did he do those things? And then around Easter, we kicked off a new series that we're wrapping up today called Upside Down Kingdom. And in this series, what we've done is we've looked at what's called the kingdom teachings of Jesus. So what Jesus said about how we, or anyone who decides to follow him becomes a kingdom citizens, how we live different in this life on this planet as kingdom citizens of God's kingdom. And so we've been in there. And so I guess the question is, where do we go from here? And part of what we're gonna do is next Sunday, we're gonna have a celebration. And you heard Ryan mentioned this a few minutes ago. We're gonna have an event called Fearless at the Park. And so we do this periodically, typically around July 4th, but we're going to meet at 10 a.m. at Dominic Lofino Park. So if you're watching online and you're local, we'd love to have you join us. It's going to be a great time where we show up there, we're going to sing a couple of songs, and we're gonna have some baptisms and then afterwards we're gonna eat and just hang out and so i would say this to you you're like i don't know if i want to do that it might be hot all that kind of stuff uh we we don't take very long there so you could stay for 15 minutes or an hour and 15 minutes doesn't matter but i would say it's really designed for you if you're new around here so if you're new here and maybe this is your very first Sunday. Maybe it's your first Sunday logging on, and you could make it. We would love to have you, because at this event, you will meet the best part of Fearless Church, and that is the people. And every church, what's the most important part? The church is the people, so it's important for you to meet the people. So I would enjoy and invite you to enjoy being with us and invite you to be part of this event. Also, for those of you that feel disconnected, our church is in a funny season right now. We've been growing a lot over the last six months or so. And so sometimes when a church grows, it's hard to get connected. And so you may show up here on a Sunday morning, you may know two or three people, but ultimately you would say, you know what? I just don't feel like I know somebody that I really know them or they really know me. I don't feel connected. And so we do events like this so that you can show up and have an opportunity, an hour if you want, an hour and a half, whatever, just to meet people. And then finally, for those that would say, you know what, no, I'm all in. Like this is my church family. I'm excited. I'll be there. If you're in town next Sunday, please show up about 15 minutes early. So instead of 10 a.m., show up about 9.45, because we need you to serve. And the number one way we need you to serve is I want to challenge you, if you're an all-in member here at Fearless Church, to meet three people that you've never met before. And they may be people that are all in and they're actively involved in fearless church in multiple ways and that's great or they may be somebody that's new or somebody that is disconnected that god's going to use you to help them feel connected so next sunday 10 a.m dominic lafino park it'll be a great time for anybody that's new disconnected or all of us that are all in the following Sunday so that's July 9th we're gonna kick off a new message series called essentials now some of you recognize even that graphic or title because over two or three year period of time we actually hit all of our essential beliefs as a church so our essential beliefs are our core beliefs that we all agree upon as members of fearless Church you may say well I don't know if I'm not a member here like I are our core beliefs that we all agree upon as members of Fearless Church. You may say, well, I don't know if I'm not a member here. Like, I don't know if I agree. And that's okay. It's still valuable for you and your family to hear that. And so this series, we're going to address the person of God, right? And we're going to address how God is presented in Scripture as the Holy Trinity. So if you've ever wondered about the Trinity, We're gonna talk about the Trinity. We're gonna talk specifically about God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. So I would encourage you to be a part of that. Then in August, we're gonna kick off a series called Fresh Start. Have you ever wanted to just kind of have a fresh start, a redo, if you will, in your relationship with God? What about your relationship with other people? What about your relationship with church? I would encourage you not only to be a part of this, but if you're somebody that regularly attends Fearless Church, even right now to start thinking and praying about who to invite to join you in August, that you would say, hey, they really need a fresh start. And then finally, in September, we're going to pick up the sequel to Luke's Gospel. And some of you already know this. The sequel to Luke's Gospel is the book of Acts. So we're going to have an Acts series that starts in September. So that's where we're going. But today, today we're wrapping up this series, Upside Down Kingdom. And again, it focuses on the kingdom teachings of Jesus. Now, Jesus was a master teacher. The way he taught, he used illustrations and parables, all kinds of different ways to connect with you. He would teach in large groups. He would teach in small groups. He would teach one-on-one, one-on-one. And if you have studied any of the gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, you'll see another place that he often taught was around the table. He would have dinner with people. He would connect over a meal. And what we're gonna look at is a four course meal, if you will, that Jesus had with the religious leaders of his day. Now, when I say four-course meal, we're not talking about food. What I'm talking about is four lessons, four lessons in one meal that he teaches these religious leaders, and it's even one step farther. It's almost like a four-course condemnation. It's not one of those fun type things. He's actually pressing against the way that they think and process. And I think as we walk through this meal and we look at the different lessons he presents, we'll see even here in 2023 that we can apply some of the hard truths that he gave to these leaders. So let's start with the first course. If you brought your Bible, you're welcome to join us in Luke chapter 14. It begins like this. On a Sabbath day, Jesus went to eat dinner in the home of a leader of the Pharisees. I want to stop right there some of you already know this but if you don't the pharisees the sadducees the scribes these were all religious leaders jewish religious leaders of the day and so these people kind of controlled the narrative of how to connect with God, how to follow God. What does that look like? And among them, Jesus, a rabbi from a little village called Nazareth, was not very popular. They didn't like him. In fact, they often said and did things. And ultimately, as you read even the gospel of Luke, you'll see they were responsible for getting a revolt against Jesus, ultimately him being arrested and executed on a Roman cross. These were his enemies. And I just pause right here because I think it's interesting how Jesus ate with his enemies. Jesus went and sat in the home of those who hated him. They didn't like him. And so when he was with them, they're watching him closely. Jesus confused them. See, Jesus came on the scene like no other rabbi, taught with power and authority, but, Jesus came on the scene like no other rabbi, taught with power and authority, but he also came on the scene offering both truth and grace. See, when it came to the Pharisees, they loved truth. They loved the commands. They loved the law. They loved knowing the law, teaching the law. Most of them obeyed the law pretty good. They loved enforcing the law, pointing out when people broke god's rules they were all about the law but not very much about love and when jesus came on the scene he also upheld the law but he also introduced love he was full of truth and full of grace so much so the apostle paul described it this way he said the word became flesh and dwelt among us i want you to think about what happened when we celebrated Christmas, like the word of God, God became flesh, Emmanuel. We saw his glory. Glory is the only son from the father full of what? Grace and truth. Not 50% grace, 50% truth. No, 100% grace, 100% truth. Grace is God's unearned, 100% truth. Grace is God's unearned, unmerited, undeserved favor. The truth of God's word is God's law and reality of how God has structured the world, His commands. And Jesus upheld both. He didn't care just about the law. He fulfilled the law with love. And this bothered, bothered the religious leaders. That's why they watched him closely. What's he going to do today? What's he going to say? Is he going to behold the law or is he going to bring in love? Is he going to be full of truth or full of grace? And the reality is Jesus is like, yes, both full of truth and grace, full of love and law. And indeed, right out of the gate during this meal first course of the meal he has an opportunity to show it there's this guy who is suffering his arms and legs were swollen with fluid biblical scholars say this is some kind of disease known as dropsy right i guess and and there's fluid that gathers in the extremities and so they jesus sees this man and there's this moment what's going to happen? Before Jesus does anything, he asks the Pharisees this question. They're the Pharisees, they're the experts in the law, they all love upholding what? The truth, full of truth, right? He says, now, is it permitted, is it allowed in the law to heal people on the Sabbath day? So we have to start by asking the same question, like what is the rule what is the law what is the command the first five books of your bible genesis exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy they make up what's called the torah or the law so if you're ever reading and you hear an author that's right and you read in there the law what they're talking about it's these first five books that make up the law and that that's where you find the regulations, the rules, the commands, things that God gave to the nation of Israel to know how to live among one another and how to follow him in the world. So he's saying, now, let's look at the law. What does the law say about the Sabbath? So let's look in Deuteronomy 5. We're called to observe or recognize the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. It is set apart. It is unique. This day of the week is not like any other day. The Lord commands us to do that. Well, let's get more specific. He says, you have six days each week to do your ordinary work. But on the seventh day, that's a Sabbath day of rest. On that day, it should be dedicated to the Lord your God. On that day, notice this, no one in your household may do any work, including yourselves. So the question Jesus is asking here, is it permitted to heal on the Sabbath? And some of you might say, well, that's not ordinary work. That's extraordinary work. That's supernatural work. Is it lawful to help people on the Sabbath? Is it okay to love amidst the law? And this Sabbath issue came up time and time again among the religious leaders and Jesus. And another occasion, Jesus has actually done a healing and they're mad about it. And so Jesus tells them, he describes him, he said, look, you guys need to understand the purpose of the rule, the purpose of the law. He says, look, the Sabbath was made for man, not the other way around, not the man being made for the Sabbath. Another way to say it is this way. The Sabbath was made for man. Why? To bless man with rest. So God gives this command to set it aside, to dedicate it to the Lord, to rest and refocus in our relationship with God and others. It's not the reverse. It's not the reverse that there's this rule that is designed to oppress with rules. So here's the first lesson of the first course of the meal. And it's this, that God's rules, they bless people. They're not designed to oppress people. God's rules bless us. They don't oppress us. Now, this is hard. Like, I want you to think about it. I don't want you to raise your hands. I don't want you to type anything online, but think about it. Do you believe that? Like, for me, I think I'm like, man, this is good. This is good until it bumps up against something that I really wanna do. And I feel like God is telling me, don't go there, don't say that, don't do that. Don't connect with this person in this way. All these kinds of things feel limiting and oppressing. It takes great faith to believe that God's rules, God's law is based on love, not on control. And part of the reason that is is because religious leaders. And part of the reason that is is because religious leaders throughout the history of the world, including somewhat even today, they use the rules, they use the law to not love people, but control people. These Pharisees wanted to oppress or control those that they led, not bless them. So we shouldn't be surprised when Jesus presents this question. You're experts in the truth. You got it down. You know the rules. You know the law, right? Is it permitted? Is it allowed to heal? I put this in here because I thought to myself, it's almost like he's saying, does the law make room for love? Does truth make room for grace? Remember Jesus, full of what? Truth and grace, full of law and love. He didn't come to abolish or eliminate the law. He came to fulfill the law. Well, these religious leaders hear it and they're like, well, we really don't like the idea of loving people. We really want to control people. We really want to hold on to the truth. So they didn't say anything. And when they didn't say anything, Jesus then takes action. He touches the sick man, this doesn't probably surprise you at all. And he healed the man, sent the man on his way. Jesus, again, he fulfilled the law with what? Love. Fulfilled the law with love, full of grace and truth. And you should ask at this point, now, wait a second, wait a second. That's grace. I understand the man didn't deserve to be healed. He didn't do anything to be healed. And God gives him grace, heals him, changes his life through his son, Jesus Christ. But did Jesus break a law? Did he break the rule? And Jesus thought you might ask that or I might. He knew those Pharisees were thinking that. So look what he says. He says, look, he turns to the Pharisees and he says to them, which of you doesn't work on the Sabbath? And to them, they're thinking, none of us. Like we know the rule. We we know the law we of course don't do that and then he gives them an example of how they regularly break their rule or law he says look if your son or your cow falls into a pit don't you rush to get him out don't you take action when someone you love someone you care about something you feel responsible for, when something happens, you take action. Why? Because the greatest law is love. There was another point when an expert in the law approaches Jesus, always trying to trick him. He said, Jesus, what's the most important command, the most important rule, the most important law? And Jesus says, the most important one. And then he quotes from the law, he says is to love the Lord God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength to which at that time everybody was like, yeah, that's right, A plus, great. But Jesus doesn't stop talking. He said, and the second is like it. The second, wait a second. And he said, the second is like it. Some of you haven't memorized, right? The second is like it. Love your neighbor as yourself. And then he goes one step farther. He says, all the law and all the prophets, all the rules hinge on these two things. You can feed them back to loving God and loving people. And as these Pharisees hear this, again, this is why they didn't like, they didn't even know, they didn't know what to say. I don't know what to say about that, Jesus. Like you loved people. We don't really love people. We love to control people, oppress people, hurt people, instead of help people. Jesus fulfilled the law with love. He was full of grace and truth. That's the first course. The second course of the meal, not only were they watching him, but I noticed this. Jesus was watching them. Check this out. He notices that when they came into dinner, they all tried to sit in the seats of honor. Excuse me, pardon me. in the seats of honor. Excuse me, pardon me, I'm gonna get that seat, right? I'm gonna get that one at the head of the table. I want everybody to see me to recognize I'm here. I'm important. So he gave them this piece of advice. He said, look, don't sit in the seat of honor. When you show up to a party, when you show up to a social situation, when you show up to a relationship, when you show up to work, conscious choice to choose being humble over being honored. Wait a second. Jesus, I was invited, therefore I'm important. And Jesus is like, they're not synonymous. Just because you were invited doesn't mean you're important. Like, think about it for a moment. Like, what if someone important shows up? Oh, I'm invited. Yeah, but they're important. Like, if that happens, what's going to happen is the host is going to show up and going to say, hey, the guy I invited can't even remember your name, but if you'll get up, this important friend of mine needs to sit down. And then what's going to happen to you? You have the walk of shame down to the end of table, right? Where you're embarrassed. He goes on and he says, he continues on. He says, but if you will instead take the lowest place at the table, the place no one else wants to be, that no one recognizes, he said, it'll turn out really good for you because in that case, there's only one way to go. When you're the last chair, only way to go is up. He says, the host will come in and say, hey friend, friend, why are you sitting down here like let's move up a seat or three seats or whatever then you'll be honored in front of all the guests okay jesus what what's your point jesus point is this in life we all have two choices we can either exalt ourselves or humble ourselves we can start off with pride and ultimately be humbled, or we can start out with humility and ultimately be exalted. You can seek honor or you can receive honor. You've gotta decide which one are you going for. James says it this way. He says, if you'll humble yourself before the Lord, crying out, God, like, I bring nothing to the table, God. I'm broken. I'm destitute. Jesus, I need you. I don't deserve a relationship, but I need you. What happens? He's gonna lift you up. Let God take care of honoring you. Jesus' point is like, we need to choose being humble over being honored in any and all our relationships. Humbled over being honored. Now it's time for the third course. He turns his attention from the guest to the host. Watch what he says. He says, he looks at the host and he says, when you put on a luncheon or a banquet, this is what he said. Don't invite your friends, brothers, relatives, and rich neighbors. I don't want any of you using this to not invite your mother-in-law to your house, right? You're gonna be like, the pastor said. Not even the pastor, like Jesus said it. You're no longer invited here. And you're like, that's my obedience, great, awesome. No, no, no, no. Jesus, oftentimes he would say things like this to expose something within their hearts. See, the Pharisees cared about appearance a lot, a lot more than they cared about reality. They wanted to appear kind. They wanted to appear generous. But Jesus confronts that. He says, if you do this, here's what's gonna happen. They're gonna invite you back. That's not what generosity is. In fact, generosity is an act of sacrifice for others, not exchange with others. You wanna prove that to yourself? He says, instead, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, the unpopular, the ones nobody wants. He says, then at the resurrection of the righteous, in other words, when you stand before God, he's gonna reward you. Why? Because you invited those who couldn't repay you. This reality that an understanding that generosity is about sacrifice not exchange and where do we see this in the greatest example in the history of the world jesus christ when it comes to your relationship with jesus and his relationship with you it is initiated all one-sided it's his generosity you bring nothing to generosity. You bring nothing to the table. I bring nothing to the table. It's not an exchange where Jesus needed us. No, we need him. When he hung on the cross and he paid for the penalty of our sin and said, man, I'll take it. I'll take the punishment of sin on me. We brought nothing to the table. He brings generosity, grace, love. He brings it as an act of sacrifice, not as an act of exchange. And he confronts these leaders, he said, no, no, generosity, generosity is gonna be sacrifice, paying for those who can't return it back, not exchange, so you appear to be kind or generous. Finally, the fourth and final course of the meal, fourth and final lesson Jesus wants to teach. This guy's watching all this stuff and he hears what Jesus says and he's sitting at the table and he explains, okay, now I'm gonna share something eternal. This guy says, what a blessing it will be to attend a banquet in the kingdom of God. So it's almost like us saying, man, won't it be great when we get to heaven? Man, it's gonna be awesome. It'll be wonderful. I can't wait. It's going to be perfect, right? To which Jesus responds with a story. Watch what he says. A man prepared a great feast, and he sent out many invitations. Whenever I've read this in the past, and even this week as I'm reading this, it reminds me of God's heart and his invitation for all people to be part of his kingdom, part of his family. The invitation's wide open. The apostle Paul, writing in Timothy, says it this way. He said, look, God our Savior wants everyone to be saved, even you. You say, I don't know, man. Like, if I was God, I wouldn't want me. Like, the things that I've said and done, of you you're really good at rules and laws and you think man maybe god loves me because of the stuff i do right and you're wrong you're saved by god's grace not by your works then others are on the other end of the spectrum and and you've done stuff that you're like there's no way god could could want me and accept me and you've got to wrestle with this reality that the invitation is open to all people. He desires all people to be saved, all people to know the truth. What's the truth that God wants you and I to know? That there is only one God. And there's one mediator who reconciles or makes us right with God. Only one way to be made right with God, and that's through faith in who? You could see it in Jesus Christ. Jesus is that bridge. He's that way to be made right with God. Faith in Christ who gave his life graciously, generously, gave his life to purchase freedom for, and you need to put your name right there, for everyone. Doesn't matter who you are or what you've done. This is the message that God gave the world at the right time. Jesus wants us to know, and you need to know, and I need to know, the invitation to be part of his kingdom, the invitation to be part of his family is open and available to all people. So Jesus continues his story. He says this man, he makes a banquet, he sends out an invitation to all people, and then when the banquet's ready, he tells his servants, go out and tell the people. It's ready. It's time. The banquet's ready. Go check it out. Now watch how the people react. They start making excuses. First guy's like, man, I just bought a field. I must go inspect it. Please excuse me. Like I've got stuff going on in this life. I've got some investments. I've got to do some stuff. Next guy's like, yeah, I just bought me five pairs of oxen. Like, I want to try them out. I want to check it out. Like, I want to make a little bit more money. The other guy's like, I'm married, so I don't attend, right? Can't attend. Kids, ask your parents about that joke later, and it'll be great. So these guys are making excuses, right? And the servant, he just reports back. He said, man, when I went out, I invited people, and every one of them had a reason why they couldn't come to the banquet, a reason why they rejected the invitation. So it says here, the master's furious. And he says, okay, we'll change it up. We're gonna invite people that are poor, the crippled, the blind, the lame, the people that are hurting and lonely and broken. So the servant goes out and he invites all these people. He comes back and he reports there's still room. I mean, some people have responded, but there's still room for more. What do we do? but there's still room for more. What do we do? So the master says, okay, we gotta be more aggressive. Go to the country lanes, behind the hedges, urge anyone and everyone you can in every way you can to come and be part of this banquet. Come and be part of my family, be part of my kingdom. Why? So that the house will be full. And this is the last lesson Jesus teaches in in this meal that we would know that in the kingdom of god there's always room for those who respond there's always room for those that hear the invitation and instead of making an excuse they go in all in commitment they a bible word for it is they repent they turn from their old way of life to Jesus. There's always room for those who will respond. And then Jesus ends his story and ends this meal with a short phrase. It's an allusion to the way the Jewish people in the first century, honestly, to the way the Jewish leaders in the first century responded to his appearing. Watch what he says, last phrase. He says this, for none of those I first invited will even get the smallest taste of my banquet. Again, the Jewish people, specifically the Jewish leaders, rejected Jesus as the Messiah. Apostle John writes it this way, he says, he's talking about Jesus here, he came into this very world that he created, but the world didn't recognize him. In fact, he came to his own people, the nation of Israel. And what? They rejected him. But there's good news. John continues and says, all, doesn't matter who they are, doesn't matter if they're Jew or Gentile, doesn't matter their background, all who what? Believed in him and accepted him, accepts the invitation to be invited to be part of the kingdom of God through faith in Christ, he gave the right to what? To become children of God. An invitation available to all, but all have to respond in belief and faith. It's an invitation. It doesn't matter who you are, that in the kingdom of God, there's always room for those who respond. So in review, that's a lot of stuff in one meal. You're like, man, Jesus is teaching stuff all over. Let's go back and tell, what was Jesus's table talk? Let's go back through them, right? First one, what? God's rules bless people. They don't oppress people. Jesus honored the Sabbath by healing the man. He fulfilled the law with love. Next thing we learned is that we are challenged to choose being humble over being honored. Well, I wanna be recognized. I want people to know how awesome I am, right? I want people to know the hard work I did. And Jesus is saying, no, no, no, no, choose being humble. Remember what he said? Hey, take the lowest place of the table. They're not gonna know your name down there. Not much light down there. They can't even see. Is there somebody down there, right? He said, take that place. He goes on and he presses. He says, think about it. This is how we practice humility. What about generosity? Generosity, it's an act of sacrifice, I meant to put sacrifice, sorry about that, but it is service too, but sacrifice, not exchange. I'm gonna sacrifice, I'm gonna give to those who can't give back. And then finally, remember the last lesson? The kingdom of God, there's always room for those who respond. So my question as we wrap up is this, how about you? How have you responded to the Jesus invitation to follow him? If you were to sum up Jesus' ministry time and time again, he invited people, come, come follow me. But Jesus, I don't understand everything. That's okay. Some of his most faithful followers didn't believe him when he said he would die on the cross and raise from the grave. They're like, what? That doesn't even, that's crazy. I don't know what you mean. cross and raised from the grave. They're like, what? That doesn't even, that's crazy. I don't know what you mean. But they just faithfully followed one step at a time. And they made a decision to respond to his invitation with a commitment. See, we have this choice when it comes to Jesus's invitation to follow him. We can make excuses, and we saw people do that. I got all this other stuff going on with my business, with my personal life, whatever it might be, or we can make a commitment. God doesn't just invite you to come and join and be part of his eternal kingdom, his eternal table. He loves us so much that he sent his only son to us. His son that would say to you and I, look, I stand at the door and knock. Like, if you hear my voice, if you understand who I am as the son of God, if you understand what I've done, and you open the door, you invite me and say, Jesus, I want you to be Lord of my life, my Savior, my treasure, my everything. What's his promise? I want you to be Lord of my life, my Savior, my treasure, my everything. What's his promise? I'll come in. Not a religious system of rules and regulations, but a genuine relationship where I sit down with you and we become friends. Have you ever thought about being a friend with God? Jesus wants to be your friend, my friend, that we know him and he knows us. And he accepts us not because we deserve it, but he accepts us because he's full of truth and grace. He fulfills the law with love. This is who Jesus is. This is what he wants for us. So imagine, what would it be like today? What would it be like right now as you're watching online to stop making excuses of why you can't follow and start making a commitment. To make a commitment, to receive this invitation, to respond to this invitation, to experience God's grace, His mercy, His forgiveness, His love, His grace, by entering into a real relationship with Him. What would it look like for you to make a commitment today? For some of you, I think it's a commitment to search for Jesus. And what I mean, I think it's a commitment to search for Jesus. And what I mean by that, it's a commitment to say, I want to figure this thing out. And instead of coming to the table with a heart that is skeptical, you come with a heart of sincerity. And you start to think, okay, honestly, some of you that are naturally more skeptical, don't raise your hand, please. But honestly, like, have you ever had a season in your life where you pursued knowing Jesus with sincerity? What if you just did it for the rest of this year, for the next six months, whether it's at Fearless or not? We would love to have you join and be part of the journey of discovering who he is and experiencing his love, his grace, his truth, his mercy, his law, his love, all of who he is, and understand how to have a relationship with God through faith in Christ. We'd love to help you in that journey, but if we're not the place, we'd love to help you find the place. But what if you made a commitment today between you and God? I'm going to search for Jesus. For some of you, you believe Jesus is God's son. You believe that he died on the cross and you're crazy enough to believe that he rose from the grave. And you believe the person of Jesus and the work of Jesus is the only thing that can make you right with Jesus, but you're making excuses, reasons why you can't. And for you, maybe it's time to start following Jesus, to recognizing you're not good enough, but he is, and to receiving his forgiveness. You know, the Bible says that if you confess your sin to him, he's faithful and just to forgive your sin and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Jesus can take whatever sin, whatever mistake is on your mind right now that you think prevents you from knowing and following God, Jesus can eliminate it, cast it out far as the east is to the west, forgetting it as if it never happened. He wants to offer you his forgiveness. He invites you to respond to his forgiveness in the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God, what? It's always room for those who respond. What if today you ask for God's forgiveness? Jesus, please forgive me of my sin. And what if you made a commitment? I'm going to follow you to the best of my ability. I'm not going to be perfect, but when I fall down, I'll get back up. You can help me. I'm going to walk with you. What if that's day? And for some of you, if you're like me and you had a season of searching and now you're following Jesus, what if you make a commitment to say, I'm Remember the story Jesus told. What did he say the master said? The master told him, he said, go out, leave this place, log off. He said, go to the country lanes, to the hedges, anywhere and everywhere God puts you at work, on the sports field, at school, neighborhood, home, wherever it is, and urge anyone you can find to come in. Why? Why? So that the house will be full. Jesus' invitation to follow him is an invitation to join his mission. Some of you remember some of his first disciples. He said, hey, come follow me and I'll make you fishers of men. Come follow me and I'll help you. I'll help you go and share Jesus, share the gospel, lead others to follow me. It's an invitation for us to join his mission, an invitation for us to go from this place and proclaim that in the kingdom of God, there's always room for those who respond. So what would it look like for you today? I mean, imagine yourself sitting at that table that day and Jesus is spouting off and he's saying these various things that he said. He said, look, look, look, look, God's rules. Man, remember, remember, they're to bless people, not oppress people. For some of you, I believe God has you here, has you logged on, because there's a rule, there's a command, there's a way of God that you're pressing against and you're wondering, man, it seems like it's limiting me. And I believe Jesus was like, no, no, no, no, no. Like, is that rule designed? Are we not allowed to love in the midst of that rule? No, it's love and law. It's a rule that's designed to bless you, not oppress you. What about choosing humility over being honored? What about a generosity that's sacrificial, where they're not going to pay you back? But I did this. Do they even appreciate? Maybe they don't appreciate what you did. You know, there's a lot of people right now that don't appreciate what Jesus did for them, right? So you may be in that same boat. And then don't forget in the kingdom of God, there's always room for those who respond. Let's don't make excuses. Let's respond in faith. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, I thank you for this conversation that you preserved around this table. Lord, Jesus had an amazing way of teaching and you preserved these words for us in the Gospel of Luke so that we could read them today and be challenged by these different ideas in just a brief dinner. He taught so much. And Lord, I pray, I ask you to help us respond in faith. Whatever's getting in the way of our willingness to begin searching for you, to begin following you, or to begin sharing you, God, eliminate those things. Help us respond in faith. There's always room in your kingdom for those who respond. May we be found faithful. God, we love you. We thank you for this day together. Now, as you're praying, here's what I'm asking you to do. We're almost done. We're going to sing a song together, and you're welcome to stand up and sing. You're welcome to stay seated. You're welcome not to sing, whatever you want to do. But I'm going to ask you before we leave and get going to the other things that you may have planned today or this week to just take a moment to respond. And maybe it's something I never said or no one has said this morning, but you feel like God's telling you to do something and you just need to commit and say, I'm not, I'm going to stop making excuses. I'm going to make a commitment. For some of you, it's that commitment to say, that's it, I'm all in. I'm following Jesus. I'm tired of being on the sideline. Jesus, if you'll have me, which the answer is yes, then forgive me and I commit to follow. Whatever it is, just respond so that in a few minutes when we leave here, there's no regret, no excuse, only faithful response. God, be with us now in this time of response. May we honor you and obey you. We love you and pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Thank you.

It's a simple question. Which one of your children do you love the most? It was a question posed to a young lady by her therapist. And he asked her, which one of your children do you love the most? Well, she's slightly offended and responds probably the same all of us in this room would. Well, I love all my children just the same. Therapist didn't buy in it. He shoots back. There's no way that you can love all of your kids just the same. Come on, tell me, which one of your children do you love the most? Well, now she's starting to get a little perturbed and she tells him, I already told you, I love my children all the same. Well, this therapist is not giving up. So he takes a different angle. He says, I know you're supposed, that's what you're supposed to say, but you're in a safe place. Now tell me, which one of your children do you love the most? She pauses for a moment, actually starts to break down and cry. And so she tells him, okay, okay. Um, I don't, I don't love all my children just the same. Whenever I have who is who is sick i love that one more whenever i have one who's lost i love that one more whenever i have one that's confused or is in pain i love that one more pain, I love that one more. And when I have one who's bad, and I don't just mean naughty, I mean really bad, just plain bad. I love that one more. And then she ends it with a very simple, but for those exceptions, I really do love all my children the same. What would you have said? Well, today I want us to consider whether or not God loves any of his children more than the others. We're picking up this series of more than a man where we're looking at the story of Jesus through the eyes of Luke. Luke wrote one of the four gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. You'll find them at the beginning of your New Testament. And Luke is telling us this story. We've been in this series for the last several weeks. And we are so glad that you've joined us here today because we're gonna pick up this story in Luke 15. So if you guys wanna turn to your Bibles, Luke 15, this is where we'll be today. Luke 15 is known as the lost parables. The lost parables, you know, you have the lost sheep, the lost coin, the lost son. Many of you are familiar with these parables you know you have the lost sheet the lost coin the lost son many of you are familiar with these parables and so when we talk about parables parable is nothing more than a fancy bible name for a story jesus uses parables to get his point across to his people that he's talking with sometimes the message is veiled sometimes it's not Sometimes the message is veiled, sometimes it's not. But let me set the scene for you before we dive in. Jesus is having a meal with some tax collectors and sinners. So if y'all have been here the last few weeks, we've talked about these tax collectors. They're the ones who have turned their backs on their fellow Jews, actually started working with the Romans, collecting taxes and charging exorbitant amounts against the Jews. And the Jews can't stand them anymore. So he's having dinner with these tax collectors and sinners. Sinners, you may hear the term Gentile, which is another word for just someone who isn't a Jew. So anyone who isn't a Jew is a Gentile. They are lost sinners. Gentile, they are lost sinners. So Jesus is, is having a meal with them and talking. And then there's another group that shows up uninvited and, and they are, they're gossiping under their breath about Jesus. And they're criticizing that he would be having a meal with this low life of people. See, to the self-righteous Jews, these people were utterly lost. They were lost causes. They were lost to God, not worth their time. Now, they weren't very inconspicuous about it because Jesus overhears him. And he's about to lay down some truth to these people who have stumbled upon their mealtime. Now there's, there's much debate out there as to who Jesus is talking to in this exchange. You know, is it the Pharisees and, and the teachers of the law, or is it the tax collectors and the sinner? Whose is it? Well, we're going to dive in and see if we can't find out. I think it's important for us to know who that is. So we're going to start over here with a parable of the lost sheep. The parable of the lost sheep. So let's get into it. Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn't he leave the 99 in the open country and go after the lost sheep until she finds it. And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders, goes home. He calls his friends and neighbors together and says, rejoice with me. I have found my lost sheep. Now this is where it gets really cool. I tell you that in the same way. There will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous persons who have no need to repent. Now this passage often gets kind of looked over for a second, but I want to pause for a second. I want to test something out here. Would people really leave 99% of their livelihood to go search after the 1%? I mean, is it really true? I mean, surely isn't there a shepherd out there saying, I'm not leaving 99% of my livelihood to go chase after the one who was stupid enough to leave a good thing. Surely somebody out there saying, he can walk back in the same wool he left in. It seems a little reckless, doesn't it? It does seem a little irresponsible to chase after that one. But we just sang about it, reckless love. Do you know that that song was pinned on this verse? I know that there's nothing about God that is reckless. That's not the point of that song. But to a human, to a a sinner who's being honest and it does seem a little reckless doesn't it there's some sheep read read recently a story of these sheep in the highlands of Scotland and every now and then these sheep would wander off. There's this sweet grass in the mountains there, and they'll wander off, and they'll jump down a little cliff facing, you know, 10, 12 feet in search of this sweeter grass, and they get stuck down there, and they start bleeding out for their master to come save them. And they start bleeding out for their master to come save them. Well, these shepherds will sometimes wait for days until the sheep have eaten all the grass. They're tired. They can barely stand up before the shepherd comes back, puts a rope around himself, shimmies down and saves the sheep from the jaws of death now i know what you're thinking probably the same thing i'm thinking why didn't he go get him from the get-go why didn't he well here's what i read turns out sheep are pretty skittish and let let's just be honest. They're not the brightest barn animal in the yard. And if that shepherd had gone after those sheep when they first came out, they would have jumped to their death. Churches were like that sometimes. It's a way with us. A lot of times we don't get right with God until we've hit rock bottom. Until we've eaten all the grass and there's nothing left. We have no friends. We've lost everything. If you're a wanderer out there, I tell you that the good shepherd will bring you back to the moment that parable of the lost coin. I like this one. It's a little bit shorter, but I like it. Let's get into this. So he says, or suppose a woman has 10 silver coins and loses one. Doesn't she light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it. And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, rejoice with me. I have found my lost coin. In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents. Anybody ever lost their billfolds, their wallet, their purse or whatever? Especially if any time has gone by. I mean, you're turning over everything in your house, aren't you? You're looking everywhere for it. And when you finally end up finding it in the freezer where you put it, you have a little party, don't you? I mean, you get excited. And if you're anything like me, I guarantee you there's some people out there, as soon as you find it, you kind of bow your head real quick and you say, thank you, God. Thank you, God. Thank you, God. it you kind of bow your head real quick and you say thank you god thank you god thank you god man this lady was excited she lost a whole day's wage she just got her two-week paycheck i guess i got paid every two weeks back then too she had 10 coins and each one of those represented a day's wage. Guys, don't mistake. When she found that coin, she celebrated. Let's move on to our final parable here that Jesus tells. It's the parable of the lost son. You may have heard of it as the parable of the prodigal son. So let's jump into this one real quick and see where we go. Jesus continues. There was a man who had two sons. The younger one says to her father, Father, give me my share of the estate. So he divided his property between them. Now, guys, can we stop here for just a second? Does somebody not cry foul at this? I mean, how realistic is this? Is this really? Can you imagine the gumption of this kid coming to his father and demanding his inheritance early. I mean, this sounds like a slam dunk for daddy. He's holding all the cards and son's pushing all in on a seven-deuce offsuit. He's all hat, no cattle. He has nothing to offer here. Dad could have easily told me to go butt a stump, but he doesn't. Here's where this part is so important. The father concedes immediately and grants him his wish. Now check this out, knowing full well, knowing full well what was about to happen to his son so what happens son gathers up all of his inheritance he's he's going to become an international traveler sounds exciting right moves off to a distant, squanders his inheritance on prostitutes and everything else out there. He's sowing his wild oats. Now notice there is a distinction. There is a difference here between this parable and the other two. This kid did not just happen to wander off. He didn't get lost. He willingly and rebelliously walks away from his father. He ends up squandering everything that he's had. He's lost everything. He has no money. He has no place to stay. He has no food. The kid is starving And he realizes I gotta go get a job So that's what he does he goes and hires himself off to some farmer farmer sends him out to feed the pigs He's out feeding the pigs. He's so hungry guys. He's actually contemplating eating the slop that he's feeding the pigs. Now, I don't know if any of y'all ever been to a pig farm before, but this Texan has, that's not pretty at all. Lucky for him, he has an epiphany and we pick up the story here in verse 17. Let's go over and check it out. When he came to his senses, he said, how many of my father's hired servants have food to spare? And here I am starving to death. Here's what I'll do. I'm going to sit out and go back to my father. And I'm going to say to him, father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. And I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants. He finally realizes what he left. What he had back home. He realized how selfish he was. You know the sad part of this story? In his sorrow, he lost his own identity. He didn't even feel worthy to be called his father's son anymore. So that's what he decides to do. He gets up, He heads back home. Father sees him coming around the bend far off. And this is important here, guys. He runs to his son. He doesn't walk to his son. He runs to his son. He doesn't stand back and say, that boy can come to me. He's the one that left. That's probably what i would have done no he runs to his son with joy so the son comes hat in hand he repents to his father he's sorrowful Hat in hand. He repents to his father. He's sorrowful. Now I want you to notice here, guys, there's no animosity from the father's side. Could you have done the same? No, he has compassion. He hugs and he kisses him. He doesn't play this passive aggressive game and make him feel guilty. Instead, this is what he says he tells him but the father says to his servant quick bring the best robe and put it on him put a ring on his fingers sandals on his feet bring the fattened calf and kill it let's have a feast celebrate Let's have a feast. Celebrate. For this son of mine was dead and alive again, and he was lost and is found. So they began to celebrate. And guys, let me tell you, this was no backyard barbecue. They were partying like it was 1999. Whoop, whoop. Guys, they threw a party that everyone came to. Said what? The older brother. He enters into the scene. He's out in the field. He hears all this commotion. He comes running back saying, what's going on? Servant comes out and says, hey, brother, you're not even going to believe this. But your little brother has come home this is amazing and we are throwing dude we are throwing the wildest party you've got to come nope i'm not going servant goes in tells daddy daddy comes out and pleads with him said son servant goes in and tells daddy. Daddy comes out and pleads with him. He said, son, come. Come to the party. He goes, I'm not going to the party. He had his own party. He's going to have him a pity party. And that's what he does. He tells his dad, after all of these years, I've slayed for you. I've never disobeyed you. I've done everything that you've asked me to do. And you won't even give me a goat to party with my friends. A goat? Little brother comes home. He squandered everything you ever gave him. I'm prostitutes. Not only does he not get a goat, he gets the fattened calf. What's the deal here? Can't a guy get a goat? Listen to how his father responds. He said, my son, you are always with me And everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate and be glad. Because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again. He was lost and is found. Isn't that like our kids sometimes? Something good happens to one of their siblings and the others just can't handle it they lose their minds don't they i want something too and they can't even begin to celebrate because they are so ungrateful about what they've already been freely given by all means guys this older brother was was a son. He worked for his son or he worked for his father, obeyed him. Here's the one thing that he missed. He lived under the good fortune, the protection and the favor of his father. And he could have asked his father anything that he wanted, but he never did. Instead, he sat around and just felt like he got shafted. Imagine the hubris, the pride on this young man. It's blinding him from rejoicing with his brother. His father rejoiced. The lady who found the coin, she rejoiced. The shepherd who found his sheep, they rejoiced. As we look back at all of these three parables, there's a lot of rejoicing going on. And the one question I posed when we started this today was who's Jesus talking to? Who is his audience? Was it the Pharisees and teachers of the law? Was it, was it the righteous or should I say self-righteous? Was it the tax collectors and sinners, the lost. Can I tell you the answer is probably both. I know this first group gets all of the press when this gets preached on in churches. And I do want to give it its due time and briefly spend some time touching on some of the common takeaways here. So let's look at this first group and see what Jesus is telling them. I would say the first thing he's telling them is, excuse me, gentlemen, there's no one exempt from God's grace. There's no one that's too dirty to repent and return to god you know it's interesting that jesus uses this analogy of lost items you've ever stopped to think about it god doesn't lose anything he uses this terminology because the pharisees believe the sinners to be lost to God. They were the lost cause and they weren't worth their time. I think Jesus in his message was also telling the self-righteous that, I'm sorry, but my father welcomes all who are lost and so should you. We have many people who have walked through the doors here at fearless or joined us online. They're lost every single week. Many, their lifestyles may not represent the righteousness laid out for us in the Bibles. Why should it? They hadn't found Jesus yet. Instead of looking down on them and condemning them, we should welcome them and celebrate that they're here in the first place. But that's not the group I want to talk about today. I want to talk about this other group, these lost sinners. They're the one who always get left out of the discussion. And I think it's important. And for a moment, if you guys will, I want us all to experience these parables through their point of view. Why? Because they were there and they were listening. What do you think their big aha moment was? I would argue that probably their biggest takeaway was this jesus saying you have value i don't care where you are in your walk i don't care what you've done you have value guys jesus is don't miss this. Jesus is making a very strong point here. He tells many parables throughout the New Testament. Rarely does he tell three in concession to make one point. Guys, don't miss this. He's wanting them to know how valuable they are. Have you ever looked at the progression of these three? I never did till I was preparing for this. Check this out. His very first one, he's talking about property. The lost sheep. One in a hundred. Yeah, I'll go back for the one in a hundred. And hey, if you can't catch that, well, surely you can catch this next one I'm gonna tell you. How about money? I know everybody in here cares about money. We'll talk about your money here for a second. And not just 1%, we're gonna go 10%. We're gonna up the stakes here a little bit. Can everybody catch on with me here? Everybody good with me here? And if your heart is so hardened, you can't get that surely, surely flesh and bone. You only got two of those. Do you notice with each parable, the value appears to increase, not only in the what was lost, but also in the ratio. Jesus wanted to show you have value. Surely someone, everyone can relate to at least one of these. Second takeaway is this. Man, God welcomes you home and celebrates your restoration. He celebrates your restoration. I mean, we just got through reading them in the three parables. Let's go back and review. It says, rejoice with me. I found my lost sheep. I tell you that in the same way, there are more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous persons who do not need to repent. And then the coin, rejoice with me, I found my lost coin. In the same way, I tell you there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents and finally we get to the lost son bring the fattened calf and kill it let us feast and celebrate for the son of mine was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found so they began to celebrate so to the lost, Jesus is saying, you have value. I celebrate your return. And church, can I tell you this? He's also saying, I will let you fail. Do you notice that this is the only parable in which the owner of what was lost does not leave to go look for it? Why is that? Father didn't go look for his son. That son was already in full-scale rebellion. that son was already in full-scale rebellion. Some of you parents know what I'm talking about. They didn't just come to this point where he decides he's gonna run off and rebel. He'd been there. His father knew what was about to happen with his son. Here's my question for you, parents, if I could, for just a moment. How many of you would allow your son or daughter to experience pain, to recognize their sin, to recognize their depravity? to recognize their depravity. Have you ever stopped to consider that every time you rescue your child, that you might be interfering with God's plan for your child to discover their own faith in Christ? Not yours, but theirs. in Christ, not yours, but theirs. We often do this because we don't want our kids to go through hard times. We just don't. It's like, Father, bring my child back, but don't make it hurt. Father, bring my daughter back, but don't let them get in trouble with the law. Father, please bring my child back, but please make sure they don't get a disease. And we put all of these things on there and God's probably up there just saying, give me an honest parent that will say, bring my child back, whatever it takes. We just don't want our kids to go through hard times. There's a great saying. It goes like this. Hard times create strong men. Strong men create easy times. easy times create weak men weak men create hard times this happens because we don't want our kids to suffer you may not believe it but we church we are currently living in easy times from my generation all the way down to Gen Z, we really don't know what hard times are. And now, please, I don't mean to minimize whatever struggle or whatever difficult time you are having. But in the grand scheme of things, what's going on in our world today, we don't know hard times here in America. I would tell you though, there are some people in this room today that could enlighten us on hard times. These are people that have lived through the Great Depression, through world wars. These are the strong men and women who created these easy times. So church, not for a moment should we not realize that our problems are first world problems. We just want our kids to have it better than we did. We just want our kids to be what? Happy. We want our kids to be happy. Well, can I tell you something? God cares more about your holiness than he does your happiness. And we short change our children when we get those two mixed up on your pathway to holiness god will let you fail in fact failure is the first step to repentance oftentimes it's the first step to repentance. Can I talk to just the people who are feeling lost out there first for just a moment? Maybe you feel like you're that lost sheep. You're wondering if God would come looking for you. Heck, would anybody come looking for you? Well, if you happen to wander in here today, God has for you. Well, if you happen to wander in here today, God has found you. Maybe you never knew you had an owner at all. Maybe you identify with this lost coin. That lost coin never knew he was lost. Maybe you've never met Jesus and you wandered in here today, he's found you. And possibly for some of you, you maybe identify with this young son. You didn't just happen to wander off, but you willingly and rebelliously walked away from God. Maybe you were hurt. Maybe you were hurt by the church. You've traveled as far away as you can, as fast as you can. Can I tell you that you've never traveled too far, that you can't return home? God's found you. This could be your moment to return home. I think a lot of people stay away from God because they fear that he would reject them. Jesus tells us in John, he says, the ones to come to me, I will never cast out. If you will come to God, he won't turn away from you. He will love you and accept you. Would you come home today? Can I tell you, it's very easy to do. Just confess to him that you've been away. You've been living life your way instead of his way. Tell him that you want to turn around and come home. Repent. Ask Jesus to forgive your sins, invite him to come and live in your heart and in your life. Does God love you? Absolutely, unequivocally, yes. He demonstrated that love for you while you were still a sinner, away from God, living life your way. He left the splendor of heaven to come and pay a price that we owed. Church, we need to celebrate the restoration of our lost brothers, our lost sisters. And listen to me. Don't be disheartened when your father appears to love some of his children more. Those who are sick, who are lost, who are hurting, or maybe being just plain bad. Because in those moments, he does. Let's pray. Father, thank you for letting your word speak. And I pray that as each one of us walk out of here today, we would wrestle. Which one are we? Which one are we? Fathers, for those out there who've just wandered off, let them know that you found them and you want to bring them home. For those that never knew you, oh, what a joy to introduce you. For those of us that have just rebelliously walked away, Father, remind them how much you love them. Remind them the value they have. Bring them home and let's celebrate. In Christ's name, amen. Amen."}]}

Not just our church. I love the church. Growing up, I was blessed. My mom and dad took me to church all the time. In fact, when I was still in my mom's belly, my parents were actively involved in church and serving in church, hosting things in their house, like small groups, whatever it might be. And as I look back on my life, I think about some of the very best friends I've ever made and still have to this day. Some of my very favorite memories of my life are tied to being part of the local church. But I also have a story where dozens of people in my life, and maybe you have this too, have told me, well, yeah, I love Jesus, but I hate church. So I start to ask, you know, like, tell me a little bit about what you mean. And they begin to describe to me, they said, well, when it comes to Jesus, I feel like I've experienced some love from Jesus. And typically a person that would say that would say, I kind of understand what the gospel, so that's Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, kind of how do they describe what Jesus would say, what Jesus would do, the way he treated people. And they're like, man, I feel like Jesus would love me. And they begin to describe how, man, I recognize he died on the cross. And the Bible, it's very clear, he didn't die on the cross for his sins. In fact, he was tempted in every way, but never, ever, ever disobeyed God, which is crazy, right? But he died on the cross as a substitute to pay the penalty of my sin and your sin. And they would share to me, man, as I think about who Jesus is and what he's done for me, I feel like I've got love from Jesus. But as I think about the church, what I've got from the church is hurt. Hurt from church. It's a common thing. Some of you might be watching online and you chose to log online because part of your story right now is you've experienced some pain, some trauma, some hurt. Maybe it's not you. Maybe it's somebody you really care about. The majority of people in the room would say, no, no, I don't hate the church. Maybe I've experienced a little bit of hurt, but there's probably in a room this many people, at least somebody that would say, yeah, you know, I'm here today, not because I love church. I'm here because I love the person that invited me, the person I'm connected to. But when it comes to church, honestly, there's some very real hurt, some very real trauma, some very real damage. You know, things have been said by the followers of Jesus and done by followers of Jesus throughout the centuries, throughout world history, throughout your history. It's caused some real hurt. And maybe it's not you, but you would say, you know what, if you're asking me, if I think about it, maybe I do have a few friends, family members, coworkers, teammates, classmates, that honestly, they would never log on. They would never come to church because what they've experienced is hurt from church. And this is kind of a tension. One of the apostles of Jesus, the apostle John, so he's one of the inner three, listen to what he wrote. He said, look, all who believe, doesn't matter who they are, who believe in Jesus and who he is and what he's done, and they accept him or receive him. In other words, anyone and everyone who decides to follow Jesus, that he is going to be their Lord, their master, their ruler, believing who he is and what he's done, he gave the right to be called children of God. So if you're a follower of Jesus, you're a child of God. Jesus would say it this way, my family are the ones who know me and obey him. So I guess the question we have to ask ourselves is, is it possible to really love Jesus and hate his family? When we think about your own life. I mean, if you walked up to me and said, man, Chris, I love you, but man, I hate your wife, right? I'd probably go, boom, you know, right like that. And then ask for your forgiveness because we're in church. Church hurt. Applied right there. Seriously though, like, does it work that way? Can you love Jesus and hate his family? So I start to think, and I want you to think with me, what do people need? Maybe it is not you, but maybe you can sit here and you can listen for somebody that's in your life, somebody that's been hurt by church. What do they really need from church? And again, I just want you to know, especially if you're new to church, right, or you're coming back to church, whatever that may be, that eventually you will be hurt by church. If you've never been hurt by church, it's probably because you've attended church gatherings, but you've never really been part of church. Because every church I've ever been a part of has the same issue, the same thing that hurts people. It's not doctrine. It's not denomination. The same problem, the same thing that hurts people. It's not doctrine. It's not denomination. The same problem, the same thing that's going to hurt you at some point is people. And you already know this. Like you're going to in your lifetime be loved by people and hurt by people. I mean, most people, they, they experience this, or I guess understand this by the time they're in elementary school, experience it sometime by middle school, if not in middle school, right? That's why it's a tough time. And by the time you're a high school student, you expect this. And so you're like thinking, well, yeah, Chris, that's not real big revelation there that people are going to hurt you and love you. And sometimes it's the same exact people, right? That hurt you and love you. And sometimes it's the same day, hurt you and love you and sometimes it's the same day but something deep in us something deep within our souls even if you're not a follower jesus knows this this shouldn't be the case with followers of jesus you you feel like something they shouldn't be known by love and you're right in fact jesus said look the world they're going to know that you're my followers my disciples if you love one another in fact those that have been hurt by church what they really need from church is the same thing you and i need from church they need a church that's full of love a church that's marked by love for god love for one another and love for their neighbor love for the insider and love for the outsider people that have been hurt by church whether it's you or somebody you, they need a church full of love. So we've gotta ask ourselves, how do we become that type of church? How do we make sure we're operating and functioning in such a way that the end result is we are a church, as the Apostle Paul would describe, that is actually healthy, and that we're growing and full of love, that we're healthy, in other words, we have right beliefs, or at least we're pursuing right beliefs, not just opinions, that we're pursuing right behaviors. That way we're not a church that's full of hypocrites, but we're a church that says, hey, we're not perfect, but we're pursuing and repenting and we're turning towards right behaviors. How do we become a church that's growing? In Acts chapter two, the first church, God was adding to their number daily those that were being saved. How do we become part of a church that there's actually numeric growth? There's actually spiritual growth where a year from now, you and I are a little bit more like Jesus in our journey. How do we become a church that's full of love? Love for God, love for one another, and love for our neighbor. Well, the apostle Paul presents to the church in Ephesus and says, if you function this way, this will be the result you get. And as we look at how Paul addressed the first century church, what he was doing is he wrote these letters. Sometimes they were in response to questions or circumstances or issues. Other times it was just a directive letter to say, okay, now that you've decided to follow Jesus, here's how you function together. And he loved to use this body illustration. You'll see it in Romans. You'll see it in Ephesians. You'll see it in Corinthians. And in fact, in first Corinthians, he says it this way. He says, let me explain the body of Christ to you. The human body has many parts, right? The many parts, they make up one whole body. So that's how we ought to think about the body of Christ. Again, when he's referring to the body of Christ, what he's talking about is people that are committed to Jesus and knowing and following him and committed to one another. So he's like, when you think of the body of Christ, think of it as all of us together. In fact, he continues on and he says it this way, all of you together, all as a group, you're all all Christ's body. Each of you is part of it. In other words, not one person accurately reflects Christ to the world. We all need each other to do that. It's the ultimate team sport. Each of us working together expresses Christ's body. This is why Jesus said, where two or more gathered, I'm present. If you want to experience more of the presence of God, the power of God, the image of God seen in the world. It's not about me. It's about we, all of us working together. So how do we individually work together to accurately display and reflect the image of Jesus to the world around us such that we are what? Healthy, growing, and full of love. Well, this is what Paul was addressing to the church in Ephesus. Going back to Ephesians 4, he says it this way. You need to understand that God makes the whole body fit together perfectly. God has designed this thing. In fact, as he talks about it, not only with the church in Ephesus, in the church of Corinth, he would say it this way. God's put each part exactly where he wants it. In other words, he has an assignment and a design. Design and assign different roles, different responsibilities, different ways that he wants the body to fit together perfectly. Paul continues and he says, as each part does its own special work, it does what? It helps the other parts grow. So let's break this down. What does he mean by each one does its own special work? Here's the reality. As a follower of Jesus, you have been designed and assigned a specific role and responsibility in the greater body. You are a part of a bigger body, part of the team, a member on the team, important, vital, critical to the mission of the team working together. So how do we identify that? One of the primary ways we identify our role, our responsibility, our assignment in the body of Christ is through something called spiritual gifts. If you've been in church for a while, you've probably heard that. What in the world is a spiritual gift? What happens, and Paul addresses this actually in the same letter, earlier in the letter, in Ephesians chapter 1, verse 13 particularly, he says this. He says, whenever someone believes in Jesus and decides to follow him, they are sealed with the Holy Spirit. In other words, they receive the Holy Spirit. Now, you probably recognize that last month we actually, as a church, went through a series where we looked at who God is, specifically how God reveals himself in both the Old and New Testament as the Trinity. This is an idea that we see revealed in Scripture, and that's the idea. You've heard this before, right? One God, three persons, Father, Son, Holy Spirit. And what Paul would say is he'd say, the moment you commit yourself to the Son, Jesus Christ, you receive the Spirit. The Spirit of God, the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead resides in you. So you now have an empowerment and an ability to function in your design and assign task, your special role. So what is your spiritual gift? Well, commonly all throughout the centuries, followers of Jesus, people who are considering following, people that are highly committed to following, have asked questions like, I don't know what my spiritual gift is. How does that work? committed to following, have asked questions like, I don't know what my spiritual gift is. How does that work? And so at one point, Paul actually writes in response to a letter from followers of Jesus in Corinth. And watch what he writes. He says, dear brothers and sisters, regarding your question about spiritual gifts. So apparently they had written a letter to him wondering. He said, I don't want you to be uninformed. I don't want this to be some kind of mysterious thing that we can't understand and we can't explain. So he goes a little farther and he gives us a little theological foundation for what spiritual gifts are. Check this out. He says, there's different gifts, but there's the same spirit. There's different ministries, but there's the same Lord. There's different activities, but the same God produces each gift in each person. Now, I want you to think for a moment. One of the primary functions of the church, of we, the body of Christ, not just Fearless Church, but all churches throughout the history of the ages, since Christ's ascension, since the day of Pentecost, the function of the church is to reflect and replicate the image of God to the world. To reflect and replicate the image of God. In other words, people get to know who God is by spending time with his people. We should be, this is why some of you that grew up in church, you know, when people say, oh man, we are the hands and feet of Christ. We are the body of Christ. People get to know Christ through us. And that's why Jesus, even before he left, he said, the things that you to do are greater than what I do. And Jesus was talking about throughout time as believers and dwell with the spirit of God and filled with the spirit of God and function as the body of Christ, more people in more places are going to see who Jesus is and experience his love, his care, his compassion, and his salvation through God's people, the way that we reflect the image. Now, Paul's saying, okay, as we are image bearers of God, watch how it works in our distinct roles, responsibilities, and giftedness. Notice you'll see he even refers to the Trinity here. Same God, God the Father. Same Lord, Lord Jesus Christ. Same Spirit, the Holy Spirit. And he reminds us, when you think about it, one God, three persons, Father, Son, Holy Spirit. Father, Son, Holy Spirit are identical and the same in their eternal attributes and characteristics. So for example, God is holy. What does that mean? The Father is holy, the Son is holy, and the Spirit is holy. God is all powerful. What does that mean? The Father is all powerful, the Son is all powerful, the Spirit is all powerful. They are the same in their eternal attributes and essence and characteristics, but the Trinity is different and distinct in their roles and relationship with one another and us. Best example that any of us who've been a part of church for a while can understand is it was the Lord Jesus Christ who died on the cross. It was not the Father, it was not the cross. It was not the Father. It was not the Spirit. And when someone commits their life to Jesus Christ as their Lord, as their Savior, as their treasure, they are forever connected to the Father and they're actually sealed by the Spirit. Again, different roles, different relationships. And this is Paul's point when he's saying, when we consider our roles and relationships within the body of Christ, we are the same. We are all children of God. It doesn't matter whether Gentile, Greek, man, woman, young, old, we're all equal, the same, the same as children of God. But we're different and distinct in our giftings, in our assignments, in our design, in our giftings. As we have different gifts, different ministries, different activities, we reflect both the unity and the diversity of the Holy Trinity. This is our function as a church, to accurately reflect and even replicate the image of God all over the world. Unity and diversity, same and different. So he says, in light of that theological foundation, a spiritual gift and empowerment and ability is given to each one of us. So if you're a follower of Jesus and you've committed your life to Jesus, you have the Holy Spirit. Therefore, you and I each have at least one spiritual gift, one spiritual ability, empowerment, so that we can follow the design and the assignment God's given us. And so why does he do this? Is it so we can show off? And you know that's not true. But sometimes there's certain gifts that are more public. Paul addresses that. You say, is that what it's about so that you can receive the glory? Of course not. Is it so you can sit on the sidelines and watch others? Sit quietly with your gifting, with your empowerment, the Holy Spirit residing in you, empowerment the holy spirit residing in you but silenced in you as you watch others is it so we can continue to not know what it is for a lot of us the majority of us we don't know what it is i said man i don't know what my spiritual gift is i mean i got some ideas i might ask you but i really don't know he says no no no every single follower of jesus every single follower of jesus has been given a spiritual gift, so what? So we can help each other. Your gift is not about you. Your gift is about helping me, and me helping you, and we helping one another. We need to help each other, how? The apostle Paul says, we help each other because we help each other grow. So in other words, when I decide not to use my gift, and you decide not to use your gift, we continue to be weak. We continue to be frail as the body of Christ. And Paul said, that's not how you function when every part recognizes, wait a second, I've got a role. I've got a responsibility. I am a distinct part of the body of Christ. Then what happens is we become healthy, growing and full of love. Not only what people who have been hurt by church need, but what I need and what you need, what you should expect from a church is to be healthy and to be growing and to be full of love. And because we recognize this is true, then we can say this in our church, everyone is a significant contributor. Great. Awesome. We can leave early. No, we can't because most of us, most of us don't believe this. We believe something like this. Most of us say, hey, in our church, someone else is a significant contributor. It doesn't really matter if I show up tonight, but I sure hope he or she shows up because they make a difference when our group is together. That person's important. I can see they've got a lot of Bible knowledge. They've got some pretty good life practices. Like they're significant. They're important, but not everyone. Now, I just want you to know, the devil, now when I say that, heart rates usually go up because there's people in the room that say, man, I don't believe in the devil. Why won't you know? I believe in the devil. I believe in the devil. Jesus believed in the devil. And the devil, Jesus describes, watch the way he describes, he says, the devil has always hated the truth. In fact, because there is no truth in him, when he lies, he's actually operating out of who he is, out of his character. For he is what? A liar and the father of lies. I like to tell people he's the father of lies. That means he originates lies, but he's also perfected lies. Let me tell you something about the devil. The devil is really good at lying. And you know who he lies to? Us. And we start believing things that are not true about ourselves, about other people, even about God. I believe some stuff, I wish I knew what they were. I would confess them and I would change my belief to align with God. I'm learning, I'm growing. And if you want me to be transparent, I need you to help me, help me understand what are the lies I'm believing. I think maybe God may use me at time to help you believe what lies. I mean, watch how he does it. He takes the truth and he twists it. Check out this lie. If our church, in our church, someone else is a significant contributor, that's true. That is true. That is a truth but look closely don't look at me for a second just look at the screen what is the lie behind that what is the lie that i buy into and you buy in you see it here it comes someone else is wait wait a second in our church i'm not a significant contributor there's a ton of people people just like you some of them who are you that believe this i am not a significant contributor so we we have to ask ourselves, do we believe what Paul said in church in Rome, that each part has a special function, that each part is mission critical, that significant contributor, that we all belong, we're interdependent, or do we believe that we're not significant contributors? And you're like, dude, the reason I, no offense, Chris, the reason I believe that is because it's true. Like if I don't show up here, guess what you're gonna do next Sunday? You're gonna meet here, gonna sing some songs. You'll probably get on the stage and get sweaty again. Right, like things are gonna keep going. I'm not that significant. Let me tell you, the reason we buy into this lie is because it follows our behavior. When we behave a way long enough, it alters our beliefs. Let me show you what I mean. God has created you for two things, relational connection and significant contribution. Relational connection, you're probably not surprised when I'm gonna say this, God's designed you to connect with him, not a religious system where you just, a bunch of do's and don'ts. I'm talking about a genuine dynamic relationship where you get to know God, not just facts, but have a relationship conversation, hearing him and him knowing you. And it's awesome. You're designed for that, but you're also designed to connect with other followers of Jesus. If you decide to follow Jesus sometime this week, sometime this year, just know immediately that connects you in a supernatural way, in a spiritual way, to have an eternal family, brothers and sisters in Christ. You're designed to connect. You're designed to connect with people that don't follow Jesus. You're designed for relational connection and significant contribution. And here's what happens. When we behave in such a way that we don't have relational connection and don't have significant contribution, we start to believe lies. An example, the moment you feel like you don't have relational connection and don't have significant contribution, we start to believe lies. An example, the moment you feel like you don't have a significant contribution in your family, at work, in your community, at church, what's the lie we start to believe? I'm not that important. Some of you are sitting here today and you believe, you believe the lie that you're not that important, or if you're not relationally connected. Not only am I not that important, but no one cares. No one cares. I have no purpose. I have no purpose. No one would miss me if I'm not here. You see, when we lack one or both of these, do you see how it can spiral us down? And it's because we have behaved that way. Now, let's bring it down to church for a second. When you walk into church, when you walk into any meeting of the church, whether it's a large one like this or it's a small community group or one of our training events or environments, you're asking this question. You don't know you're asking this question, but I'm gonna tell you, you're asking this question will i be loved by them and served by them will i be loved by them will there be a relational connection and will i receive what i need from them can they help me in my growth i mean i'm telling you when people leave church not just fearless church but any church it's usually one or both of these they'll say man we just we never got connected and i know what they're saying they never experienced being loved because let me tell you something when you are around people that love you it's real hard to disconnect from there you're like like that's who that's who you think about when you're talking with your family and you're like who do we want to hang out friday night it's probably people that love you it seems simple but you think about it you feel loved, you all of a sudden have a relational connection. And then people say, well, I never got connected or I never got my needs met. We weren't able to grow. So because of that, pastor, like we're leaving our church. And I, that's something that's a monthly meeting that I have with people and I feel bad for them. And I tell them, yeah, yeah. But the apostle Paul would say, this is not gonna lead to health. This is not gonna lead to growth. This is not gonna lead to becoming a loving church. Instead, he would flip it and he would say, what if people didn't look only to their own interests, but the interests of others? Like, what if we showed up to any given gathering that we have? Again, whether it's three people, 300 people, doesn't matter and we said i'm showing up with this attitude today i'm going to love them and serve them is this the place god wants me to love them and serve them if you're looking for a perfect them we're not the place i'll make it easy for you far from it unfortunately neither is the church down the road god's people are righteous because of god not because of them and they they put their faith in who Jesus is and he's making them, making me more like him, but it's a long process. So can you love broken, imperfect people like the one in the mirror that you'll see tomorrow morning? Is this the place? Love them, serve them, love them, serve them. Now here's the problem we have. Love them, serve them often becomes secondary, not primary, when we think about how we function in the body of Christ. Secondary, not primary. It becomes secondary. Relational connection and significant contribution is secondary. When you think about your role, your responsibility, your design and assign, it becomes secondary. And when it becomes secondary, we say, these become important when I have time to or want to. Like, dude, when I have time to do and I want to, I will relationally connect. Man, I'm busy. And that's true. It's true for you. It's true for me. I mean, look at your calendar. Most of us, and this may sound like an exaggeration, but do it this week. You'll look. There's like 14 plus hours planned out. Work, school, extracurricular activities, chores around the house, right? All these kinds of things, hobby. There's all kinds of things. Before you know it, you're like, I don't have time. So if I have time to, or if I want to, but the reality is you're like, I don't know that I want to because you just told me people are going to me they will but people are also gonna love you and some of us don't feel loved because we don't have time to or want to to relationally connect we don't have time to want to to be significant in our contribution to the body of Christ we feel like we're not significant we don't have time to don't want to and we we miss out. And when we do that, our behavior alters our belief. Our behavior alters our belief. And because this is secondary, not primary, if I have time to or want to, all of a sudden we start believing the lie that in our church, I'm not a significant contributor. We believe it because we live it. We believe this because we live this way. We don't relationally connect and we don't make significant contribution because we don't have time to, we don't want to. And that's secondary, not primary to how I connect to the body of Christ. Yet every one of us, every one of us, even if you're not a follower of Jesus and you're like, yeah, I guess if I became a part of this church, like I would want the church to be healthy and growing and full of love. Like we don't advertise on our website. Hey, come to our church, man. We're unhealthy. Like we do a lot of really bad stuff. Yeah. And we're declining. Like every week we say goodbye to dozens of people. It's great. And we'll feel a lot of conflict. I mean, it's more conflict than Thanksgiving meal at your house. Like, show up. It's great. And people are like, no. Right? Even people that don't follow Jesus, even people that have been hurt by church, they would love to experience a church that's healthy, growing, and full of love. But the only way, the only way we can experience that is when we function the way God's put it together. When each part does its own special work. When each part does its own special work. When each part recognizes they are a significant contributor. And when that happens, we begin to live out this truth that in our church, everyone, everyone is a significant contributor. Everyone is mission critical. Now, not everyone believes that. But what about you? What could God do in your life? What could God do through your life? Many of you know, one of my favorite verses in scripture that inspires me, encourages me. I believe this about myself. I believe this about every single one of you that I'm looking at. And however many I can't see through the camera online, like I believe this is Ephesians from same, same letter that Paul is writing here, chapter three, verse 20. All glory to God, because it is all about him. It's not about us. He goes on, he says, who is able according to what? His mighty power at work within you. Catch that? How do we get the power of God? Remember what we talked about? When you decide to follow Jesus, you get the spirit, the same spirit that rose Him from the grave. So any of you that are followers of Jesus, or if you later decide to follow Jesus, you will have the power of God within you. To do what? To do tiny, small, insignificant things. If your translation says that, return it. Get your money back. You can translate that word infinitely, exceedingly, abundantly. In other words, way, way, way more than all that you're praying about or imagining. All that you're dreaming. Among the leadership of our church, we like to say it this way. We like to say we need to be a church that we dream big and start small, simple, strategic. When people grab onto this idea and they begin to understand how important they are to God and how important they are in his body, the church, all of a sudden they begin to think, I wonder if it wasn't dependent on my qualifications. Because see, a lot of you, the way you talk about or think about yourself, you would never let somebody talk or think about your child, your friend, your spouse that way. Some of you are like, God can't use me because I got all this junk in my past. I don't know enough about the bible i and you've got great excuses those are great lies that you believe from the devil and god says great it's not according to your power it's according to my power now start rattling off what i can't do get a list what is it god can't do yet his word says i can do it through you infinitely more than all that you ask or imagine. So start dreaming big. But the problem, the problem is a lot of us, we get stuck up here and we never start. We never start because it's got to be big. But what if we started small, simple, and strategic? Like what if right now God has you online or in this room because he wants to give you a fresh start. This series is all about having a fresh start. The big idea behind this series is do something different. Do something different. What if today you make a fresh start? And instead of just dreaming big or sitting on the sideline or whatever we've all done before to fall into the lie of believing we're not significant contributors, what if, what if you do something different and you just start small? You say, well, what does that even look like? What if you start small and you just serve in your community group? You just serve those people in your community group. It may be five other people, maybe if it's larger, 10 other people, but you just serve in your community. See, community groups is the primary place you will discover and utilize your spiritual gift. Community groups are the backbone of our church. Our church, I would say to anybody, is only as healthy as our community groups. That's why we have to prioritize serving first in our community groups. And many of you might say, well, I'm not even in a community group. Well, maybe that's your next step to say, man, what can I do over the next few months, over the next year, to try to connect with some kind of group of people in a smaller context? Because as you study the New Testament, if you start reading the New Testament, ask yourself, where does that happen? Like when you read a description of what they were doing in any of Paul's letters throughout the book of Acts, whatever it might be, and what you're gonna notice is a lot of times where it happens is in the context of a smaller group of people, typically meeting in a house. Many of us, we don't know our spiritual gifts. We don't know where God's designed and assigned us to serve because we're never in a context to be able to discover that. So what if you started off small and serve it in your community group? So what if you started off small and serve it in your community group? Now, here's the problem. The tension is small doesn't feel significant. You're like, man, I thought, man, you were getting me fired up. What could God do in and through me? And I was thinking like thousands. And you're like, what about five? It feels small, right? You know, and you can go back and check out this message. But as we were studying the book of Luke earlier this year, we discovered in the kingdom of God, small is significant. It's funny how sometimes something as small as a mustard seed, like let's say faith, could move a mountain. And Jesus, he started off small. We are part of his grand movement, but he started off small. There were 12 disciples. That's not a huge ministry. Like you don't get your face on the cover of a magazine in first century jerusalem if you have 12 followers as a rabbi and and i'm not saying as you read the gospels they he had interaction with some different people and large crowds would sometimes gather but if you watch constantly who's he invested in all the way to the very end when he went to that upper room just before he was arrested and crucified for my sin and your sin he's's with those 12 again. And he's having a conversation. They share in the Lord's supper. He wraps a towel around his waist, remember? And he starts washing their feet. And he says to him, he says, look, I've washed your feet. You might want to do that. I've loved you. I've served you. I've given you an example, an example how to love and how to serve a small group of people. What if you do something different and you just start small? What if you start simple? And by simple, I was trying to think, what's the easiest thing you could do? You dream big, but you start small, you start simple. What if you serve on a Sunday? So any given Sunday morning here at Fearless Church, we have over 200 places for you to serve. It's over 100 per service, places for you to serve. It's over 100 per service, places for you or your family to serve. On a typical Sunday morning, we average about 800 people in our church that are high school and above. So 800 people, 200 spots. Think about it. What if you just said, I'm going to serve simply once a month? I don't know where my significant contribution is, but I could sacrifice 60 minutes, sometimes 90 minutes, get here a little earlier, stay a little later, whatever that may be, to serve as I search for the significant assignment God has for me. We'd love to tell you where we need you. The way we do that, we have different things. We have this thing called Exploring Serving. We run maybe three or four times a year. The next one's September 10th. In fact, if you want to, you can get out your phone and register for it right now. But it'll meet right back there. There's an area we call the base camp. You can check it out back there. It's an hour event. It happens during the 11 a.m., right? So it'll be funny in a few weeks when nobody's in here and you're all back there. And I But you find that place and just say, okay, I'm gonna keep it simple. And then finally, start strategic. Small, simple, strategic. Strategic is that you would just serve for a season. A few weeks, a few months, maybe a year. I promised myself, if God ever opened an opportunity for me to serve as an elder or pastor, that I would reverse what I grew up in. And we see, when I grew up in church, when you volunteered, when you stepped in and you started serving, the understanding, and it wasn't spoken, but it was understood that you were going to serve till Jesus came back. And so when it came time for the pastor, so who wants to serve? Who wants to step up and make an eternal impact? We were all like elementary kids. We're like, oh, well, you know, faking like fake a stroke, do something, whatever it is. You're not volunteering. And I said, if ever I get to be an elder or pastor, I want to somehow lead a church that we can just serve for a short season, high commitment, short season. Like what if it was just this fall. You say, all right, dude, serve once a month. Okay, September, October, four times. Just as I try to step in and discover what is the design? What is the assignment God has for me? What is my significant contribution in the body of Christ? What if this is the time for a fresh start? You do something different. You start small, simple, strategic. Like remember, remember in our church, everyone is a significant contributor. like remember remember in our church everyone is a significant contributor can you imagine just dream with me just for a moment what could happen if hundreds of people believe that we don't have to imagine paul told us he said if that happens if everybody understands that their part is important it's special it's significant it's a contribution that changes all of eternity and helps other parts grow you know all of a sudden what we become is healthier. We continue to grow and we become a church full of love for God, full of love for one another and love for our neighbors. And what if, what if, what if you didn't just believe it for everybody? What if today you made a fresh start and you started believing it about yourself? I'm gonna tell you, not everybody, in fact, most people won't or don't believe this but what about you you can't control what the person next to you thinks but what about you what about you what if this is the fresh start for the first time what if god has you here today because he wants you to know you're important to me so much son so that i would send my only son to die on the cross for you you're important to me and you're important to me so much so that I would send my only son to die on the cross for you. You're important to me and you're important to my body, the church. You're significant in your contribution. What if you stopped being a fan in the stands that watched other people and you became a player on the field? What if you said, I'm going to commit to have an attitude, love them, serve them, no matter whether I'm going to my community group, I'm going to commit to have an attitude, love them, serve them, no matter whether I'm going to my community group, I'm going to re-engage or another training event or a Sunday morning, I'm walking in and I realize I am significant. And the reason I know that is because in our church, everyone is significant. And when we all get that, we're promised to get healthy, to grow and to be full of love. And friends, that's the kind of church I wanna be a part of. That's the kind of church you deserve to be a part of. That's the kind of church God wants for you. That's the kind of church that can reach out and connect with somebody who's been hurt by church, and all of a sudden they come in and they start to get loved by church and all of a sudden they come in and they start to get loved by church and loved by Jesus Christ who loves and died for his church. In our church, everybody, including you, is a significant contributor. Let's pray. God, I thank you for the Apostle Paul's challenging words. Man, I feel a lot like we're the church in Ephesus. We're learning. What does it look like to follow you? And how do we function in such a way that we become the best version of what you want us to be, what you want to do among us? And here you bring some hard words, some very real words, some direct words for them in the first century and now for us in the 21st century. And Lord, I pray for those individuals right now that God, you're prompting them to not only understand, but apply the reality that they are significant in the body of Christ. Protect us against those lies, the lies of the devil that tell us we're not significant, we're not important, we're not mission critical. And God, help us embrace your truth, the lies of the devil that tell us we're not significant, we're not important, we're not mission critical. And God, help us embrace your truth, your truth that says everyone is a significant contributor. We love you and we look forward to what you're gonna do in and among us as each one of us leave this place taking our next step that is small, simple, and strategic to have a fresh start with you. We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen."}]}

We just closed our eyes, so I want everybody to close their eyes. I'm going to tell a story from Scripture, and I want you to picture it. And online, if you're online, close your eyes too. It's okay. You're not going anywhere. So close your eyes. Here's the setting. You're in a field. close your eyes. Here's the setting. You're in a field, a field and there's sheep. Okay. And in this field is a sheep pen. And that's all I'm going to give you because we're now going to tell you a story. So in this story, there's a person, there's a person that walks up to the sheep pen and I'm hoping you're picturing this. There's a person that walks up to the sheep pen, and I'm hoping you're picturing this. There's a person that's trying to get into the sheep pen, and he's climbing over the wall. And as he climbs over the wall, you realize he's there for no good. In fact, he must be there to hurt the sheep or to take the sheep still, or he's a robber. he's coming to do, like take them somewhere else. And as you're picturing this, then another person comes up and he enters through the opening in the sheep pen. And you realize as you're watching on that this must be the shepherd, the shepherd of the sheep. And the sheep know their shepherd, They know his voice. And the shepherd comes in and calls them by name. And as he calls them by name, they listen, they follow him. And as they follow him, he leads them out of this sheep pen and he gathers them up. And as he gathers them up, he walks with them. He walks ahead of them, and they follow him, because again, they know his voice. And as you're picturing this sheep following them, a stranger, or one of the thieves try to come up, but the sheep don't follow the stranger, because again, they don't know his voice. And that's the story that Jesus tells. You can open your eyes, and I'm going to read this to you from Scripture, John 10. And I want you to picture this now. You used your imagination, so let's take a look. I tell you the truth. Anyone who sneaks over the wall of the sheepfold, rather than going through the gate, must surely be a thief and a robber. But the one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. Jesus goes on and says, the gatekeeper opens the gate for him. And the sheep recognize his voice and come to him. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. After he has gathered his own flock, he walks ahead of them and they follow him because they know his voice. They won't follow a stranger. They will run from him because they don't know his voice. You see, this is a story that Jesus is telling the people around him. Right before this in chapter nine, he's healed a blind man. And this blind man, the Pharisees, the teachers of the day, call him into the tabernacle, the synagogue, and they say, who healed you? Who is this man? And he's like, I don't know. I didn't see him. But I know he healed me. And I know you say the only person that can heal us is God, and so he must be from God, and they get upset. And then Jesus tells this story. And he talks about the shepherds that lead people in a wrong direction. He talks about his sheep that can listen to a different voice than other than his own. And it's kind of confusing, because as we're reading this, thank goodness right after this, he says, there's a bunch of people that didn't understand. So Jesus explained it. And he records what he says. But before we get into that, I'm guessing what you pictured when you had your eyes closed is maybe you saw some different characters. Maybe you saw this shepherd that's coming up. Maybe after we read it, you see, oh, there's a gatekeeper that opens this gate, and there's sheep around. There's a sheep pen. Maybe you saw a sheep pen, maybe you saw a sheep pen or you saw somebody trying to get into the sheep pen. And you saw these characters in this story and now Jesus is gonna define who he is. But before we get there, we actually need to understand more historically what we're looking at. Because you and I, we tend to picture what we know. We tend to picture individuals here. We tend to picture maybe a sheep pen. I do at least, of one that's got a barn, a roof, and all of this, and it's got an entrance to go into. And if we go back to historical Israel and we look at what was considered a sheepfold, it's this thing all throughout the pastures in Israel that they built with rocks. And the rocks were so high that if a wolf tried to jump in or someone tried to get in, they had to work at it. And it had an opening here to where the shepherd could go in and out and get his sheep. to where the shepherd could go in and out and get his sheep. And thank goodness that Jesus doesn't just leave us hanging with this illustration. He starts explaining. He says stuff like an I am statement. He uses words like I tell you the truth. I am the gate for the sheep. Those who come in through me will be saved. He defines who he is. I'm the gate, and salvation is through me. I'm like, okay, check, got that. Jesus, you're the gate. Now let's keep going. He says, I am the good shepherd, and this is where my brain goes, what? How can you be the good shepherd and the gate? Because in my head, I'm seeing three different people. I'm seeing the gatekeeper, the gate, and the shepherd. And he says, no, I am the gate, but I'm also the good shepherd. I know my own sheep, and they know me. And so if he's the shepherd and the gate, then who's the gatekeeper? You see, the thing is, is what shepherds would do that day is they would take their sheep from one location to another, and they would get to this sheepfold either during the day or the night, and they'd put their sheep in, and they literally would become the gate. The good shepherd would sit down in the gate knowing that this was only entrance where a wolf could come in or somebody could come and steal the sheep and he would lay down his life for his sheep. He would protect his sheep. And so when you see this picture of the shepherd sitting in and being the gate, the gatekeeper's not needed. Because he's the gatekeeper, the gate, and the sheep at this point. And we see this one shepherd being three different things. And while this helps us get a better picture maybe of Jesus telling an illustration, it still doesn't help us define it. Because later on in this story, he goes to explain, I am in the Father, and the Father is in me. I and the Father are one. And this is where the Pharisees, the religious leaders of the day, get upset, because he just equated himself to God. He said, I am God. He's using these terms, because when people hear, I am the good shepherd, in that day, they think of David. They think of David, who was a good shepherd in that day, they think of David. They think of David who was a good shepherd. He was a shepherd boy, he'd lead a sheep and he wrote Psalms. He wrote Psalms 23, if the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside still waters, he quiets, he restores my soul. They're seeing, oh, if the Lord is a good shepherd and he's just saying I'm the good shepherd, there's a problem here. And we see Jesus define who he is. And then we get defined. Now, I don't always like to be defined by what the Bible defines us as. And so I'm not going to sugarcoat it. You and I are sheep. We don't get to be the good shepherd. We don't get to do any of that stuff. We get to be dumb animals. Like, I don't know if you ever, like, equate us to anything but sheep, right? Like, sheep are lost. In fact, later on, there's a story. In this story, it talks about sheep being lost, but in the Bible, there's a story where the shepherd will leave the 99, the flock that has each other, and go after a sheep that's wandered, that's lost. He'll go rescue them. There's a story about sheep online back in 2005 that proved that we're helpless. I mean, maybe not us, but hold on, this sheep, some shepherds had sheep, about 1,500 in their flock. This was in Turkey, and back in 2005, the shepherds decided to sit down for a meal, lunch, and they took their eyes off of the sheep. So one sheep, he had a bright idea of wandering. He's like, I'm just gonna go. And the other sheep, 1,499, decide, we're gonna follow that sheep. And so this sheep walks off a cliff to his death. Every single sheep followed. 400 of them died that day and made a cushion for the rest. Is that not a crazy story? I mean, we are helpless. This is what we're being equated to. We're also defenseless. Sheep don't bark. They don't growl that I know of. They, meh, that's not scary, right? They don't have claws, they got hooves. They can't make themselves stand up and be bigger like a bear. They can't even retreat to a shell like a turtle. All they can do is bump into you with 27 sweaters that they have on. And that reminds me of that ball game that you get in those big blow up balls and just hit each other. Like that's not gonna hurt, that's actually fun. Sheep are defenseless. And I don't know about you, but the more I walk with God, the more I realize that I am lost spiritually, I'm helpless spiritually, and I'm defensive spiritually. And as we step into this, my walk with Christ looks a little like a video that I found online. And I'm assuming what's gonna go through your mind is like, yeah, that's me too. So I want you to check out this video. No. Listen to the shepherds. Yep, yep. You see, we need a shepherd. And sometimes, sometimes I do think Jesus is laughing at me. Brian, I just rescued you. And look what you did. You jumped back in that crack in the middle of the ground. Like that was defenseless. That position, like that was not a good position to be in, right? That's defenseless. They were lost, helpless, they needed rescue. And the thing is, is we need that spiritually. And Jesus in this story, he goes on to tell, I am the good shepherd and here's my purpose. Here's my purpose. Here's my purpose. You see, we need, sorry, we need not only just any shepherd, we need the good shepherd. Like the story is about following many different voices. And we need the one that can define what good is. You see, we're all trying to search for good, right? I read a book called The Good Life, and it's not a Christian book. In fact, it's written by two Harvard professors that's been doing this study of human happiness for generations. And they've taken a lot of what they've found in their research, and they've compiled it into this book. And here's what they write about humans. Our brains, the most sophisticated and mysterious system in the known universe, that's awesome, often mislead us in our quest for lasting pleasure and satisfaction, not awesome. We may be capable of extraordinary feats of intellect and creativity. We may have mapped the human genome and walked on the moon, but when it comes to making decisions about our lives, we humans are often bad at knowing what is good for us. You see, the Bible's been saying that for a very long time. The Bible's been telling us that we don't know what's good for us, in fact, we want to know what's good for us, and at the very beginning of time, Adam and Eve wanted so bad to know the difference between good and evil that they chose to live without God. And as we step into this, we want to define what is good and evil. But the problem is is we don't know who to follow. In fact, they go on to say this. The culture we live in leads us in particular directions sometimes without our even noticing. And when we follow along outwardly pretending that we know what we're doing, but inwardly in a state of low-grade confusion, sheep following the wrong shepherd. You see, we need to know who our shepherd is, but we don't need to know just any shepherd, we need to know who the good shepherd is. Because Jesus came to do something, and in this story he tells us what that purpose is. Jesus chooses to rescue his sheep. Jesus chooses to rescue his sheep. He says, I have other sheep too that are not in the sheepfold. I must bring them also and they will listen to my voice and there will be one flock with one shepherd. Who is he talking to? He's talking about us. Like, have you ever thought about that? Like, he's talking to people that are already following him, but he's talking about going and finding other sheep. You see, Jesus is here to rescue us. We're lost and he comes and finds us and rescues us like a good shepherd. And as we go on, Jesus chooses to provide for his sheep. We're helpless, but he provides. Yes, I am the gate. Those who come in through me will be saved. They will come and go freely and will find good pastures. Good pastures. You see, this is Jesus saying, not only did I come to rescue them from eternal salvation, I came to give them safety from their future and I've come to give them good pastures to provide eternal life and a life today. He goes on and says, Jesus chooses to protect his sheep as well. He says, I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd sacrifices his life for the sheep. He tends to sit down and be the gate that guards all the stuff that could come and get us. You see, Jesus chose to do this. He decided to do this. You see, the picture of this is that Jesus truly did come to give us eternal life. But not only that, he came so that we would never perish. No one can snatch us away from his hand. This is all three in one verse. He came to rescue us. Rescue us from what? Death. He came to provide eternal life. And he came to protect us because nobody can take us away. This is what God the Son has come, and this is his purpose in life, and we get to choose to follow him. Why do we have that choice? You see, at the very beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, Genesis 1-1. There is God, and he creates. There's another verse that says that God is the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end. There's no start with God and there's no finishing with God because God always is. And so if God is creating things, it says God spoke and light came into existence. God spoke and the sun formed. God spoke and day and night came. God spoke and you read this all the time and as he speaks and things sun formed, God spoke and day and night came. God spoke, and you read this all the time, and as he speaks and things are created, he defines them, and he defines them as good. Scripture says it is good, and by the end of the time, he says let us make man in our image, and he does so and he says okay, we're done. It's very good. This creation that I made is perfect. This creation that I made is perfect. In John, John begins by writing, in the beginning was the word. And the word was with God and the word was God. He was with God in the beginning and through him all things were created. You see, John is equating Jesus to God's voice at the beginning. And as they're doing this, we have to come to realize that as God, our good shepherd, created everything good. And then you know the story. Along comes the serpent. And he says, oh wait, I forgot, there's a key little part here where God defines what we can and cannot do, right? So he looks down at Adam and Eve and he says, hey, you can eat from anything in the garden except for the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Because you don't need to know that. What did they get to do? They got to live with God. The scripture's clear that God walked with them in the garden You don't need to know that. What did they get to do? They got to live with God. The scripture's clear that God walked with them in the garden. They got to talk with him. They got to be in his presence. This was what the garden, this is what creation was meant to look like. And then the serpent comes along and says, does God really mean that? He knows that you won't die, but your eyes will be opened to good and evil. You will get to define what is good and evil. And when you do so, you get to be like God. And Adam and Eve decide, that sounds pretty good. In fact, we wanna be like God. We wanna know the difference. And so they choose death. Sin wasn't a word back then. Disobedience to God wasn't a word back then. All they knew was that if we eat, we die. And so what did they do? They chose death over life with God. And ever since then, we choose death. We choose death every time we do something that is disobedient to God. That's what sin is. If you lie, you choose death. If you follow a different shepherd, you choose death. You choose death, we choose death, and the problem is is we choose death, we can't choose God. That's where we come in and we're helpless. We're helpless, we can't choose to live with God because we've chosen death. And God can't unite with death because he can't die. So what does God do? He is faithful. He looks down and says, I still want to live with my creation. I want to live with humans. And so he comes into human history with God the Son, the second part of the Trinity. And he lives for 33 years. He forgoes any of his godly attributes and comes and lives as one of his created humans in the name of Jesus. And he lives life and chooses God every time. Why do I know that? Because he was perfect. He chose what God wanted him to do every time, including all the way up to death on the cross. He came and said, not my will, but yours. And this story goes on to say, I've got the authority since I choose God every time and that I am God, I have the authority to lay down my life. Nobody can take it from me. But because I have that authority, I also have the authority to raise it back up. And you see that God dies on the cross and is raised and conquers death. And here's the picture of what eternal life looks like. and here's the picture of what eternal life looks like. If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, meaning confessing isn't just coming and telling all your deep, dark secrets. Confessing is agreeing with God and telling truth. Think about a confession on like a, when you're sitting on a lawyer. What is that called? I've lost the, as a witness, they want you to confess to the story. Thank you, Jesus. They want you to tell the truth. What you're doing is you're confessing that what God is saying is true, that Jesus is God. And you believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved, you get eternal life. And at that point, something changes. Something changes. And no, you're not perfect, but you get Jesus. Now you get the garden. It's weird, it's weird. Salvation is weird. God looks down to you and goes, it's as if you've chosen me every time. You've not chosen death, you've chosen life. And when you take a look at this, and you look down and you're like, oh my goodness, I get to spend eternity with God, we get something more than that. And this is what I want you to see, that the gospel isn't that one day we get heaven. If you're choosing to follow God to be in heaven instead of a different location such as hell, you're choosing God for the wrong reasons. The gospel isn't choosing your locations, it's choosing God. The gospel isn't one day we get the absence of pain and sorrow and sin. Yes, this is true, but it's not the full gospel. One day we get the streets of gold and a mansion to live in. I really hope there's no mansions and streets in heaven, and I don't think there is, because this is creation trying to define a spiritual place. Heaven's so much more than that. It's the presence of the God we worship. And the gospel isn't one day we get Jesus. You see, the full gospel is today we get Jesus. Today we get our Father, Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit with us. We get the garden. Christ, God wanted to create us to desire to live with God. And he says, I'm gonna make a way to do it. And if you believe, I'm coming as the Holy Spirit to dwell in you, to tabernacle with you, to live with you. See, today I get to wake up and be with Jesus. Today I get to walk and have lunch with Jesus. I get to go to sleep at night knowing that I'm with Jesus because the spirit lives in us we truly get to live with God now what was Jesus's name like Jesus was given the name Emmanuel God with us at the end of his ministry when he's leaving he says the words I will never leave you or forsake you I'll be with you till the end of his ministry, when he's leaving, he says the words, I will never leave you or forsake you. I'll be with you until the end of the age. And he gives us the spirit. See, we get the garden. And the garden is life with God. That's what we get today. So the full gospel is, yes, we get eternal life. Yes, we get to spend eternity with God. But we get to start now. We get to start now. So as we go through this, look, I want you to read this. After he has gathered his own flock, after you followed him, after you know his voice, he walks with you. Ahead of you. He leads you. He walks with you. And they follow him because they know his voice. They won't follow a stranger. They will run from him because they don't know his voice. You see, you now know the voice of the good shepherd. The thief, all these other things that are trying to steal and kill and destroy, that could be our culture, that could be the enemy, that could be our thoughts, that could be our old self, could be a lot of things, could be our old self. It could be a lot of things. It could be a false teacher. They're trying to come still and kill and destroy. But my purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life, the good life. That's today. He wants to give you a rich and satisfying life today because now you get God. Not only that, you have a purpose that he can walk with you and transform you and teach you and be with you as you do so. So as we're talking about this, we get to see that as we live a life with Jesus, he rescues us today. Like I need his salvation and rescuing just as much as I did in third grade when I entered into a relationship with him. I need that today because I'm like the sheep that jumps back into the crack in the ground. I need his rescuing because I'm like the sheep that jumps back into the crack in the ground. I need his rescue because I'm a sheep that wonders, and I need the good shepherd that will come after me. I'm not somebody else's sheep, but I do need to hear his voice. He gets to provide for us today. Not only does he provide eternity, but he provides everything else. He gives us a job that we can have income with and live. He gives us abilities to do that job. He gives us a job that we can have income with and live. He gives us abilities to do that job. He protects us today. He protects us from these spiritual things that there is a spiritual war going on, and we worship the God that can control all of it. He protects us. This is what we get today. And Jesus comes and he walks as one of us. He says, look, all and the law and the prophets are summed up in this. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself. Do you want to know how to love God more? Start with Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And study the life of Jesus. Because he did it perfectly. Do you wanna know what it means to love your neighbor as yourself? Look at Jesus. Look at Jesus and see how he loved others. Parents, do you wanna see how to parent your kids? Look at how he teaches his disciples, his sheep. Don't go and call your kids sheep. But he teaches them. He walks with them. He teaches them truth in scripture. See how he teaches and gives life to his disciples. Husbands, you want to know what it means to love your wife? Look at how he loves the church. Wives, you want to know how it means to love your wife? Look at how he loves the church. Wives, you wanna know how it means to love your husband? See how he responds. See how they respond. The church responds to the love of Christ. How do you deal with your coworker? How did Jesus deal with people around him? We look at Jesus to define what is right and wrong, good and evil. We look at Jesus to define what is right and wrong, good and evil. We look at Jesus to define what this life is supposed to be about. And if we can look at Jesus and know his voice, then we know what to do as his followers. So you see, living with Jesus starts with paying attention. Living with Jesus starts with paying attention to the things of God. What are those things? If you don't know those things, start with Scripture. It will tell you what the things of God are. I can tell you pretty quickly that the things of God is not anything of man. That's creation and people. That is who God created. And because we are created in God's image, we have been elevated over creation. God didn't choose to come and save plants. He didn't come to choose to save animals. Yes, I do believe animals are in heaven. Jesus comes back on a horse, right? But he didn't come to save them. He came to rescue his sheep. He came to rescue us, and so we need to pay attention, not only to creation and what's going on around us, but the people that are in our lives. And so when we pay attention to the things of God, we now can become aware of who is around us. You see, he didn't put you at your work just to give you an income. He puts you at your job so that you could be a light in the darkness. That you could focus on his sheep that aren't in his sheepfold yet. That you can be an example of Christ at work. That's why you're there. Sure, he gives you an income. Sure, he provides. But that's not the main reason. He didn't give you your children just because. He gave your children because you are uniquely made to teach them, to spend time with them, to be an example of Christ. Be aware of those who are around you. Stop being distracted by everything else, all the other shepherds. We can be distracted by so many things. Be aware. Listen to your shepherd's voice. When you become aware of those things around you, pay attention. And I don't know how you hear God, but I do believe that he speaks to us all uniquely. I've never heard audibly the voice of God, but I do know that I need to start paying attention when my chest feels too small for my lungs. That's when I need to start paying attention to the voice of God. And when I do that, there's usually always an action. Now, it probably won't be go to Africa and become a missionary, but it may be, hey, have lunch with your coworker and listen. Maybe buy their lunch. It may be talk about your life. It may be talk about the gospel, the good news. Talk about where I am with you today. I don't know what God's going to ask you to do, but we're always given an action to take, and as a sheep, we're gonna get it wrong. And that's okay. Jesus came into this world not to condemn us, but to save us. And he walks with us every day. He places the spirit in us, and if you get it wrong, confess, God, I got it wrong today. Speak truth. I did this wrong. Give me a second chance, and our God is faithful to always give us second chances. This is how we live life with Jesus. We're realizing that we don't have to wait for eternity. We get him today. Let's pray. Father, I thank you again for just you. God, I honestly know that without you, I would be separated from you for eternity. Without what your son did on the cross, I have no chance because I've chosen death. did on the cross, I have no chance because I've chosen death. God, I'm thankful for you and your pursuit of me. God, I'm thankful for the way that you've provided and rescued us from death and provide eternal life, but God, I'm thankful that you keep doing it. God, as I am following you, I pray that you help me to stop being distracted by the things of this world, that I can be focused on the things that you want me to be focused on. And as I'm doing that, God, allow me to hear your voice. Keep speaking to me. Keep leading me as the good shepherd that you are. And God, give me the ability to take action. Help me be aware. Help me lead on what it means to be a good sheep as I follow you. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen. Amen."}]}

So I had gotten into an argument with my mother. I didn't feel loved. And I was going to run away and live on top of Bonham Junior High on the roof. That was my plan. And so that's that good-looking boy right there. Look at all that hair, my goodness. I'm jealous. We're going to be talking about jealousy here in a little bit. What I didn't tell you is that part of that story was I had left a runaway note. And my father had passed away several years ago when I was going through his personal belongings and I found my note. And I looked at it. Writing in it and I had a flood of emotions wash over me and I decided to sit down and read this manifest from a seventh grader. Now through the eyes of a 40-something year old adult. And those emotions washed over me. I got to be honest with you, it was a pretty sad note. But can I be honest with you? It was pretty stinking hilarious too. And if y'all don't mind, I'd like to share a few excerpts from my letter and see if y'all find some of the humor that I did. So I start off with a letter. I say, Shalon, Jerry, Todd, and Jason. So I've already reduced them to their first name. Because that's what adults do. Now that I'm an adult and I'm on my own, they're no longer mom and dad. Shalon, Jerry, Todd, and Jason, I am leaving now. Sooner than I thought. Shalon, I'm very sorry the way that I acted, but I had to let it out how I felt. I love y'all very much. I'm gonna do better than just read two books a week. I'm reading the Bible. So I gotta give you a little bit of context here. My mom was like one of those super brainy, smart moms, and try as she might, it just failed on all three boys. And she wanted us to read, and we had to read, and we all hated it. It was probably because it was a punishment in our house. Go to your room, read a book. So I'm reading the Bible. Again, I say for a second time, I love y'all. And don't you forget it. I wish that y'all did the same with me. I was about to say y'all pass the tissues, but y'all are in it. I'm good. I don't want anything from y'all. I just want to be loved. Now you can pass the tissues. I'll visit if that's all right. Good luck with bringing Todd and Jason up. You did all you could with me. Now I'm sure the food bill will be lower because the trash compactor is gone. I'll share more about that later. Again for a third time I say I will always love you. I've done my job. It's time for me to go. I'd appreciate you getting my money out of the bank and bring it and give it to me at church next Sunday. Oh, goodness. Keep $20 for bringing me up halfway. I give you more, but I just don't have enough. Don't worry about me. God will take care of me. I guess God is the only one who can lead me now through life. Love, Lane. And then I guess I'll turn the page and I'll find this P.S. I guess I was watching my neighbor's fish. Tells you the, I don't know what I was thinking. I said, P.S., tell Todd to please feed Lee's fish. You need to buy some more. Take care. Oh, my goodness. Who thinks like this? A seventh grade boy does. That's who does. I look back at this sad little boy. I can remember it like it was yesterday and I think of the words that were spoken into his life and how they in part shaped the man that you see here today. So as we pick up our conversation in this parenting series, I want us to consider how the words we use shape the lives of our children. So last week, Chris encouraged us to release control, to release control of our plans, of how we feel that we're supposed to raise our children and take on God's plan. And so if we're gonna release control, I wanna offer an alternate approach of raising our kids to know and love Jesus. And guys, while this is a parenting message, can I tell you that it's relevant to every single person sitting in this room with how we communicate with other people? From our friends and family, even our coworkers. I wanna confess to you that this has been a struggle for most of my life. That God's grace and mercy has covered me. And he continues to reshape this area of my life. And as we look at this alternate approach, I want you to consider how you are speaking into your children's personal identity. And as you consider that, I want you to understand that your personal identity is not something that you're born with. It's not like a fingerprint or your hair color or even your temperament. Your personal identity is something that you develop along the way, and we often develop this identity through certain life experiences, more specifically through attitudes, tones, and words that are spoken into us. Have you ever considered the words that you have heard spoken into you and how they may have possibly played a part in shaping how you are today? What were those influences? And how did they affect you? If we go back to Proverbs, King Solomon tells us here, he says, the tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat of its fruit. First reading that, that's a little bit confusing. To help us understand it a little bit, I want us to go back to the very beginning, the first place in the Bible where this concept of life and death are first mentioned. You've got to go all the way back to Genesis, in Genesis 2, and we'll pick up the story here. It says, now the Lord God has planted a garden in the east, in Eden, and there he put the man he had formed. The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground, trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. Now in the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. And then we pick up a few verses later where it says the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. And then we pick up a few verses later where it says the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and to take care of it. And the Lord God commanded the man, you are free to eat from any tree in the garden, but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. For when you eat from it you will certainly die so we have the tree of life and we have the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you will surely die you have the tree of life and you have the tree of death let's look back at our verse in proverbs. We've got two trees. We've got two fruit. We have two outcomes. We often overlook the weight of influence, the power of our words. It's a powerful weapon. And guys, there are dozens, if not hundreds of verses written in the bible that deal with the words that we say and most of them almost exclusively are tied somewhere to the tree of life or to the tree of death so let's take a look at just a few here these are from life-giving words here it says that a gentle answer turns away wrath. A gentle tongue is a tree of life. It brings healing. With our mouth, we praise God. But check this out. In these exact same verses are words of death. Words that stir up anger, break the spirit, pierce like swords. With the same mouth we praise God, we curse men. So my question for us today, church, is from which tree are we speaking? From the tree of life or the tree of death? Now, I'm not talking about the time when your kids are doing good. They're all well-behaved. They're getting along. You know, they eat their dinner without you having to bribe them or wrestle them to the ground. I'm talking about the times when big brother picks up a rock and hits little sister in the head with it. I'm talking about when little sister calls big sister a name. I'm talking about the time that you walk into the kitchen and you see little Johnny shut the refrigerator door covered with icing all over his face. And he knows nothing of this chocolate cake you speak of. From which tree are you speaking from in those conversations? Because the words we use have a physiological effect on our brain. Now, I was first introduced to this about seven years ago from one of my mentors Gary Gary Ezzo and I'm gonna borrow his teachings from for today's message had a huge impact on my life and my family's life and now I'm no neurophysiologist I'm a business guy I come from the business world hospitality industry but I can tell you there's been study after study after study that allows scientists to know with absolute certainty that what you put into your mind affects the chemistry of your brain. And as parents, what you put into your children's mind affects the chemistry and construction of their brain. affects the chemistry and construction of their brain. And that will ultimately shape their thought life and how they process things emotionally. You see, there's this very small part, there's a pair of two almond-shaped nodules in the brain called the amygdala. I'm gonna geek out on you just a little bit, hang with me. But you see, the amygdala. I'm going to geek out on you just a little bit. Hang with me. But you see, the amygdala is responsible to regulate emotion and to decode memories. That's its sole purpose. It's where you're going to find the fight, flight, or freeze mechanism. It helps us process different types of threats. And so whenever we are posed with a threat, chemicals are released in our brain. They help us determine what our next steps are. They're automatic. They're instinctive. We have no time for us to process. Amygdala is taken over. So we've got two different kinds of threats that we face. The first is physical and the second is threats that cause emotional pain. And so, let's first look at some physical threats. So, let's say that you're walking in the woods and in the pathway here you see something coiled up. Amygdala kicks in. You freeze. Chemicals released in the brain, it's taking over, you're trying to determine what this is. So I was walking down the woods last year, behind my house, there's some county woods. And I was walking down the path in these woods, just enjoying God's creation. I just kinda got caught up in all of it, and of course I get off the path, and I'm lost. And my large path got down to a little bit of game trail, and I'm ducking and everything, and I'm trying to figure out how the heck do I get out of here? Nobody knows I'm here. And so I finally figure out my way. I see the top of a house over this hill, and I start walking up that way. And as I'm walking towards my spot of exit, I step hip deep into quicksand. Bet you Ohioans didn't know you had quicksand, did you? Well, this Texas boy found it. And it's black. My amygdala kicked in. Chemicals released in my brain. And I freeze because all I can think of is Gilligan's Island. I was like, wouldn't it be like every other episode? Somebody got stuck in quicksand? And I'm thinking, okay, I've got to get out of here. I'm trying to process. Of course, I put my hand down. Now I'm thinking, okay, I got to get out of here. I'm trying to process. Of course, I put my hand down. Now I'm up to my shoulder in it. And I start to panic a little bit. I'm thinking, nobody knows where I am. I'm going to drown in quicksand. Nobody will ever see me again. And then I realized I still had one foot on dry ground. So I realized I was a little freaking out over no reason whatsoever. Here's what's interesting. Whenever there's a physical threat, those chemicals begin to disperse immediately once you realize the threat's gone. Your brain resets. That coiled up thing you saw on the pathway that you thought was a snake, once you realize it's just a coiled up rope, those chemicals disperse. Your brain resets. And mine did too. In fact, I got a little tickled out there and giggled to myself. And I said, this is going in a sermon someday. I just promise you it is. I just didn't know it was this one. I got myself out and I walked out to the exit point and I found myself on this lady's property. And she comes out on the front porch and I'm like trying to look as helpless and innocent as possible, covered in black soot. And I said, I'm sorry, I got lost, and I'm sorry I ended up on your property. She says, well, you need to be careful. There's quicksand out there. And I'm like, you think? But with emotional threats, it's not the same. They differ from physical threats. The amygdala has this uncanny ability to retrieve memories and emotional events. It can remember things that you felt, things that you saw, things that you heard. Each time that you've had a painful experience see here's the big difference see those chemicals don't disperse they go to work decoding memories and you see it's not just the actual event of hurt but it's everything that's surrounding that moment of hurt that can serve as a potential trigger in the future. Remember my runaway letter? Where I referred to myself as the trash compactor? My father affectionately gave me that word. See, my father was a good man, but he wasn't, he was raised by a mom who never told him that she loved him. She was very critical of him, and so in turn, he became very critical as well. And so he was very critical of my eating habits. I was told that I would struggle with my weight my whole life. Now, as I was looking for that picture this last week, I happened to run across a wrestling trophy from the seventh grade. And y'all know how much I weighed in seventh grade? A whopping 112 pounds. A whopping 112 pounds. And I blew up an additional 33 pounds to 145 my senior year. And you wonder, why would your father say that? Hmm. What's interesting is he only used that word one time. I'm sure that my father complimented me throughout my lifetime, but you know what? I don't remember those. I remember the criticisms. I remember the trash compactor, the one time that he said it enough to put it in a runaway letter. Think back to your history. It's hard to remember the compliments, isn't it? But a cutting word, do you ever forget that? So we need to ask ourselves again, guys, what tree are we speaking from, the tree of life or the tree of death? You see, words borrowed from the death side of the ledger injure children, even if there's no intent. Words that belittle, shame, insult, humiliate, or attack the dignity of a child become the property of the child's memory. It's not just for children either, guys. It's all of us. Even if you don't have children, words that belittle, shame, insult, humiliate, or attack the dignity of anyone becomes a property of their memory. In fact, most of us speak words of death unintentionally every single day. Think about it with me for just a minute. Older brother has been terrorizing little sister all day long. You've had it. It's up to here. What is it that you say? Hey, stop being mean to your sister. You're so mean to your little sister. Or what about, that was stupid. Or if you grew up in my house, my mom would say something with a little more colorful and say stuff like, boy, you couldn't pour whiz out of a boot with directions on the heel. There you go. You just got it. That's good. I cleaned that up for you just a little bit. We are in church, by the way. It's funny. My son, Hayden, when he was about three years old, he came up to Laura and said, hey mom, can I say stupid? She said, no baby, we don't say stupid in our house. He thought there for a second, he said, well can I go outside and say it? That's a three year old for you. What about selfish? You're so selfish. Or you're so jealous. Or what about when we're talking about one of our kids, and either they're right beside you or they're down the way, and we speak death over our children, and we say things like that one. That's my stubborn one over there. Or what about when we just say, oh man, they're just all ungrateful. They're just all ungrateful kids. See, it's not only the words that we speak, but it's the words that we consume. And we live in a world where death permeates our culture, and we live in a world where death permeates our culture from the news that we watch, from the media that we see. What does it do to us? And whether you think that you speak words of death or not, what is your brain consuming? Because whatever your brain consumes through here or here goes down to here and ultimately God's word tells us we speak from our heart. I'm going to step on some toes here if y'all don't mind that for just a second. But let's talk about the news. Does anybody ever feel good after watching the news? Let's be honest. Does anyone ever feel good after watching the news? Let's be honest. Does anyone ever feel good about it? You know, they did a study and they said after three minutes there was a 27% increase in negativity. And I didn't need a study to tell me that that was true because I had a father that lived it out. See, my father was the life of the party, but he got caught up in the news. And I don't care what side of the aisle you're sitting in if you're watching CNN or you're watching Fox News. At the end of the day it could be truth. You may believe everything they say but at the end of the day aren't they just whining a bunch? And we consume it and we take it in and we walk away from that and we find ourselves I find myself frustrated I'm angry it's like what are you going to go do? sit here and drink some more water some of you even right now may have a negative response to this message. I've been talking about some pretty negative things up here. So how do we turn this thing around? How do we do something different? Well, we could first stop by just stop speaking words of death and start speaking life. We could start there. You see, if we go back to our words of death over here, you know, all of these are taking from the vice side. These are all words of vice. Words of life are focused on the virtue. Words of death are focused on the virtue. Words of death are focused on the vice. Let me ask you something. Whenever I was putting these words of death, were you like me? Because the first time I saw this was about 20 years ago. And I'm trying to think of what the opposite virtue was of these vices. Anybody out there trying to figure out what the opposite good of this was? Can I tell you, I failed miserably. I maybe got two of them right. Because death had been so sewn into my life, I didn't know any other way, I just thought this is the way that people are supposed to speak, because that's what I heard my whole life. How about if we say, instead of stop being mean to your sister, hey, buddy, you need to be kind to your sister. How about you need to be more wise, generous, content. Instead of that's my stubborn one over there. Have y'all thought of this one yet? I know I'm stumping most of you on this one. That's my tenacious one instead of ungrateful how about how about if we're all just a little bit more appreciative you see these are worse from the life side of the ledger what do you do when you catch your kid not telling you the truth? Don't speak words of death over him and say, don't lie to me. Speak into, speak into that personal identity and tell them, son, this is not who you are. You are a child of God. And we tell the truth. I know some of you guys may think this is just pure conjecture and maybe I'm making a mountain out of a molehill. Maybe I'm overplaying this. But can I ask you a question? Do your kids know the good to do? Or do they just know the bad what not to do? Do they know what kindness is and what it looks like? Or do they just know not to be mean? Do they know what wisdom is and where to find it? Or do they know just not to be stupid? My mentor would suggest that we should elevate the virtue instead of restraining the vice. These words are so important because what do we do as parents? Let's be honest. What do we do? It's all restraint, isn't it? Restrain, restrain, restrain the evil. I gotta keep this out over here. I gotta protect this over here. Don't do this, don't do that. Stop this, stop this. And we spend little to no time at all on elevating the good, the virtuous, the life. Guys, give your kids a path to follow instead of a direction to avoid. Speak from the tree of life, not from the tree of death. I mentioned earlier that I struggle with this teaching. I miss the mark almost daily. With God still working on me, I look back to that seventh grade boy and I say, where would I be had my father not spoken that way to me? Am I gonna be critical? Am I critical like my father is, like his mother was? You may be wondering some of the same about some of your shortcomings. And for some of us in this room, we not only speak death to our kids, but to ourselves. We justify our behavior by some trauma that we've experienced in the past. Church, can I tell you, we need to stop the cycle. We need to stop leaning on past hurt to justify our behavior or our mindset. Because, guys, let me tell you something. When we justify our current condition, we give it permission to stay. When you justify your current condition, you give it permission to stay. Take your thoughts captive. Let Christ begin to shape a new identity in him. Can I offer you a bit of hope? We don't have to be defined by this identity anymore. If you've accepted Christ as your savior, he's already given you a new life. Church, this is not who we are. We are children of God. And as such, we need to change the way that we think and the way that we talk. Remember what King Solomon said? Tongue has the power of life and death. What words do we speak? We celebrated baptisms not two weeks ago, 13 of them, praise God. Was that imagery not beautiful? Died to our transgressions, raised to walk a new life. We need to borrow that same symbolism in our thought life and the words that we say. We need to bury those words of death and rise to speak a new life. Guys, if we're ever going to truly speak a life-giving message to our kids, we must first deal with the hurt and the death words that have been sown into our own lives. Parents, it starts with us. It's time for us to acknowledge our past hurt, forgive those who have hurt us, own our own words, and ask the Holy Spirit to move, to move us into a life-giving future. Church, may it ever be said of us that we speak life. Let's pray Father we thank you for your word it's the greatest parenting manual ever written we thank you for giving us life Father give us the courage, the wisdom to return that back to you by speaking life over each other instead of death. Challenge us, Father, to just take a step. Start speaking life to our kids, to our family, to our spouses, Father, even to our co-workers. Thank you, Father. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen."}]}

Not simply some information where we can pare it back, some facts, some things maybe we heard growing up or maybe we've watched on TV or heard a guy on stage talk about, but where we have a genuine, life-giving, ongoing relationship with him. This is God's desire that you would connect with him. And I would say this, for our church, that is our number one goal. We wanna be used by God in whatever way we can be to help you connect to God through a personal relationship with his son, Jesus Christ. Not only do we want to help you connect to God, but we want to connect you to the things of God. And one of the things of God that's so important that so many people, and you might be in this category, so many people miss out in knowing God and experiencing who he is is because people are not connected to God's people. So we not only wanna connect you to God through a relationship with Christ, we wanna connect you to God's people. And we have multiple ways that we do that because as you connect to God's people, that's when we begin to experience in our daily lives, the kindness, the goodness, the gentleness, the mercy, the grace, the love, the patience, all these eternal attributes of God are experienced in a very real and practical way through his people. So if you're not connected to God's people, you're not really going to get to experience some of the best things that God has for you because he wants to connect you too. So when you're connected to God's people, you're going to be connected to God's love, that kind of thing. So with that, I want to share with you two ways, real quick, easy, simple ways before we dive into this morning's message, how you can get connected. The first one is in two weeks from today, we have something we call Fearless Family Movie Night. Okay? And so everybody's invited. It doesn't matter if you're following Jesus, if you're brand new around here, it doesn't matter. In two weeks from today, on a Sunday night, right in this room, we'll be showing a movie that's appropriate for all ages. So parents, don't worry. You can bring your kids. We're going to have a blast. We'll have popcorn, different things like that. We'd love to have you be here and join us, be part of that, get to connect with God's people. And the second thing is a week after that, I think it's on August 6th, we have an event called Exploring Serving. And many of you might say, man, I want to connect through actually contributing and find a place of service, we'd love to have you be part of that event as well. And it's just like it sounds. You're simply exploring it. So if you walk in the room, it's not like we're signing you up or anything like that. You can just explore and find out ways to connect through serving. So if you'll go to BeFearless.org at any point, in fact, you can do that right now. You can find out all information about both those events and many other ways to connect to God's people. Because as you connect to God's people, you're going to experience God's love, God's kindness. You're going to experience God through his people. Now, this morning, I have the honor and privilege of introducing our guest speaker. And a bunch of you probably know this guy. His name is Pastor Chris Volz. He's the lead pastor of Fort Dayton. Our passion as a church is not just to have one church here. We feel like God's called us to not just be a lake and grow really large as a church but to be a river where people come in get trained and go out from here to be a multiplying church that starts churches both across the street and around the world well in 2022 we have the honor of being able to send out pastor chris and his lovely wife grace she was right over here actually leading worship this morning and send out their kids and their, and multiple families, over 50 people from our church send out in March of 2022. And we sent them out to start for Dayton. It's been an amazing experience. He's going to share just a little bit about that, but then he's going to be opening God's word and challenging us as we continue our message series called Essentials. Now in the first service, I got to sit through and hear, and I just want you to know, I'm not so excited necessarily that you're going to hear Chris's voice. I'm most excited that you're going to hear God's voice through Chris. So I just invite you to prepare your heart and mind, wherever you are in your spiritual journey. Do you want to hear from God? Are you prepared to hear from God? More importantly, are you prepared? Am I prepared to do whatever God tells us to in obedience, to know him better? So grab a pen, piece of paper, your phone, your Bible, whatever you want to be able to write down what you hear God saying to you through Pastor Chris and get ready, get ready because God wants to connect with you. Check this out. We'll be right back. Man, if that doesn't get you hyped, I don't know what does. I just feel like I need to sit here like, yeah, let's go. Fearless Church, right? Like, it's me. It was me on the video. Just kidding. It wasn't me. I'm so pumped to be back. It's good to see all of you. I see so many of you that I know and love. A quick update. Chris asked good to see all of you. I see so many of you that I know and love. A quick update. Chris asked me to update people and then to preach. I don't care about updates, but I do care about preaching. So I'm gonna just tell you right now for Dayton, things are going well. We are learning a lot and planting a lot of seeds. And so we are pushing our people nonstop to not just sort of like throw out seeds and see where they land but like find their neighbors people that God has put in their place in their life and level them and not just sort of like love and then run away but to walk alongside of them and just see where those relationships go there are people in our in our midst that are just reading scripture with unbelievers all the time trying to see what happens with that, praying for them and with their neighbors. It's great. There's a lot of good things happening. That's it. Great. So, forward Aidan. That's it. Turn to Matthew chapter 3. Okay, so last week, Big Dave, he started this sermon series called The Essentials. And these things are things, beliefs, that we as a church, and as the church really, like are things that we hold sort of tight-fisted. We don't hold every belief tight-fisted. Some are open-handed. For instance, there are some people who probably are not in this room who believe that getting a tattoo is a sin. They probably aren't in this room because of the video we just showed. Spoilers, that was Chris's arm. So they're probably not going to fit in here, but like, who cares? That's not a big deal. That's not something that we hold close-fisted. However, there are beliefs that we have that we won't fight people over, but there are hills we die on. There are things that we believe, and they're not just things that, you know, I as a pastor or your leadership needs to know, there are things that you need to know. You need to understand if you're gonna be a Jesus follower, there are certain things that you've gotta understand in order to follow Jesus well and be a fearless follower of Jesus who changes the world. So last week, we started talking about the Trinity, all right? It's this crazy concept that God is both one and three, that there is one God, but he exists in three equal persons. It's kind of crazy. There's not a lot of analogies that explain it perfectly well, but Dave jumped heavy into that. If you didn't watch it, I'm not going to rehash it. I'm here to talk about the Father. The next week, Brian will talk about the Son, and then the next week, I'll be back to talk about the Spirit. So we're sort of talking about the Trinity overview last week and then zooming in on each person for the next three weeks and sort of seeing what does this matter? Why does it matter that God was the Father or the Son or the Spirit? How does that help us understand Him and then relate to Him? So if you have your Bible, Matthew 3, verses 16 and 17, lays out one of the most famous verses when people started talking about the Trinity. Dave said this last week, but if you like go into the back of your Bible, you will not find the word Trinity in all the places that it's mentioned. It's a word that was made up. It was created by people that started following Jesus and they had this like understanding of who God was, but it was as if he was these like three different persons that didn't want to have to say, you know, know the three personness of god like it was a term they made up they just started saying the trinity when they were talking about this idea and it comes from matthew chapter 3 and so i'm going to read this and then we'll start to jump in it's going to be great when jesus was baptized immediately he went up from the water and behold the heavens were opened to him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him. And behold, a voice from heaven said, This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Now this is Matthew's account of the gospel story, of Jesus' life and his ministry. And this is basically the first thing, aside from his lineage and birth, that he jumps right into. And it is at the first thing, aside from his lineage and birth, that he jumps right into, and it is at the very beginning that we see God sort of reveal himself as Father. God could have revealed himself to us in many different ways, but he chose this idea of a Father, and I know that because he calls Jesus Son, and you're not a father if you don't have a son, like if you don't have a child, so he reveals himself in that way. Now, before we go any further, I want to pause and look at this word. Because for some of you, when you hear this word, you have fond memories. For some of you, when you hear this word, you have no memories. For some of you, some of the greatest moments of your life have this person next to you in it. For others, some of the deepest emotional scars or maybe physical scars come at the hands of this person. Our relationships with our fathers are difficult things. They can be blessings. They can be the source of the biggest tragedy in our lives. But to think that we don't have some things in us, maybe even subconsciously that we're not even aware of, when it comes to our Father, that we sort of have thought of God as Father because of the way that we had a relationship with our Father. Again, some of us, in great ways, as I was prepping this, like there are certain people in the room, probably, you had an example of a father who loved you and cared for you and pushed you to Jesus. And that's why you're here. Some of you, you had an example of a father who was terrible. And that also actually pushed you to Jesus and said, wow, there's a father who wants me, who I can belong to. But every single one of us has a very different, very unique relationship with our father that God gifted us here on this earth. My father passed away three years ago. I can't sit next to him in church. Some of you are sitting next to your dad right now and what a blessing that is. And I want to just say a quick prayer in the hope that we can take these things that are in our minds and our preconceived notions about who God is because of our, our earthly fathers and just set them aside for a little bit. Let me pray. God, you are our father. For some of us, that's a difficult thing that we wrestle with and we struggle with. We buck against that authority, God. I pray that no matter where our relationship is with you this morning, no matter where our relationship is with our earthly fathers this morning, we would be able to set those things aside, sort of lift out of them and with clarity and objectivity hear what your word has to say and what you ultimately have to say to us about what it means that you are our Father. Help us to see you as the Father who opens his arm to the prodigal son that comes home, who goes running to him. Help us to see you as the father who loved us so much, he sacrificed Jesus for us. Help us to see you as the one who loves to lavish his grace upon us. And let it change us and shift something in our minds, God. We thank you. It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen. Now I wanna go back to Matthew 3 and I've just it's the same passage but I've highlighted the three different persons to give a little understanding of why people talk about this text when they talk about the trinity because they're very clear persons here in this text you have Jesus who is just starting his public ministry. He's being baptized by his cousin, John the Baptist. And it's this kind of crazy moment, right, where he comes up out of the water and he sees the heaven open up and the Spirit of God descend like a dove. Maybe you've seen this in pictures on the doctor's office wall of this big dove, this dove flapping down onto the shoulder of Jesus like he's a pirate or something. But the Spirit is there. Jesus is there, the Son and the Spirit. And then there's this voice. Now, the voice is not the voice coming from the dove. It's not a parrot. There's a different voice. It's coming from above in heaven. The Spirit has descended down, and the voice is coming from somewhere else, and that's the father. And that's, this is the moment where he claims Jesus as his son. Have you ever had to claim your child? I'm not talking like baggage claim. Like, oh, you know, B-22, this is B. My son was about three years old. We put him in swimming lessons. And I thought that was pretty, I was like, great. He's young. He's going to learn how to swim. This is going to be cool. I was sort of shocked when we were there the first week. And there were like kids way younger than him. There was one girl who was like probably half his age like can't really even walk but it's like all right let's throw him in the deep you know like let's let's get him swimming right now like i don't know that's maybe that's how olympic swimmers start they're just so young but i was shocked by it but i was like that's cool like right on go after it and one of the first lessons i'm sitting off to the side and they have the kids sort of sit on this the edge edge of the pool, and the teacher takes one at a time, sort of like ferries them across the pool and gets them used to the water and all that and it's fine. And Eli, again, he's three. So waiting his turn, he's not just like sitting patiently with his hands folded, like he just starts like splashing around in the water and kicking up and some of the other kids are doing it, but he just so happens to be sitting next to this one and a half year old. And she does not like this, and she doesn't know words. She can't communicate what's going on. So she just starts to sort of like back away, and she falls into the deep end. The ledge ends, and she sinks. And the mom of this one like screams. I mean, no judgment. She's screaming at the top of her lungs. She is like in a dress, dressed like straight from work. But she is about to do like Olympic dive into this pool. She is ready because her baby is, there's a reason she's in swimming lessons, and she does not know how to swim. And one of the teachers immediately comes over and grabs the kid, and she's probably underwater for like one and a half seconds maybe. It seemed like an eternity to me. Maybe underwater for like one and a half seconds maybe it seemed like an eternity to me it maybe like double eternity to her is that a thing i don't know but the mom like she has that one and a half seconds has like unhinged her she has lost herself again no judgment whatsoever but as they pull her daughter out of the water she turns and all her like anger, like fear most of the time expresses herself in anger, starts screaming at Eli, just unloading all of her rage on him. And she realizes in about four seconds, like this is, you know, I shouldn't be yelling at this kid. He's three, he doesn't know what's going on, but she starts looking around. on but she starts looking around and in that moment I have this decision that I must make and so I got up and I walk over and I'm like I'm so sorry my nephew you know I sort of sheepishly I'm like have that this one's mine and again there's he's three he doesn't know what's going on and i pull him aside and we talk and i'm like hey buddy like you know i know you didn't mean to do this but can you say sorry you know just sort of coach him in that moment as much as he can even understand which is basically none but but something in there i'm like oh i i never responsibility for this child. When I claimed him and said, this is my son, that's mine, it ultimately means that I have what? Authority over him. I have responsibility for him. He is mine. He belongs to me. And when the father, in this passage, the voice from heaven calls down and says, this is my son, the Father actually claims authority over Jesus. Now, some of you, you're like, oh, wait, I thought the Trinity, I thought there were three equal persons. There's none that's subjected. That sounds like Jesus is underneath the Father. It is a beautiful picture of equal authority and just humble submission to the will of the Father. There's this nerdy doctrine called the eternal submission of the Son to the Father. You can look it up, Wayne Grudem Systematic Theology, read for about 28 hours, and then you'll know everything about it. But what you need to know about it right now is that somehow Jesus has submitted himself to the Father, yet is equal with him. It's this, that the God, the Father, has perfect authority over Jesus. This is the first understanding. You gotta take away from this. This matters. Here in a minute, I'll tell you why this matters, but the Father has perfect authority over Jesus. And we see this, we see this through scripture. When Jesus sort of submits himself to the Father, when he says, here, the disciples come to him and say, teach us how to pray, he says, pray like this, our Father who is in heaven, hallowed be your name your kingdom come your will be done and you might think like well yeah but he's he's god it's the same will sure okay so we go to the garden in the garden he's about to go to the cross and he says to god look god you can do anything all things are possible for you he knows the plan jesus knows the plan and that's why he's sweating blood because he knows what is about to happen he says if there's any way for this to be taken from me let this cup pass from me let me not have to do this father but not my will yours be done he's submitting to the perfect authority of the Father. Ephesians 2 says that Jesus became obedient to the point of death. He didn't regard equality with God a thing to hold on to and to sort of hoard, but he humbled himself and took on our human form. And then he died on the cross for us. And then he died on the cross for us. The father has this perfect authority over Jesus. He is in charge of him. He makes this claim on him. This is my son. But here's the thing. There's more to that verse, isn't there? He doesn't just say this is the son that is beneath me that does what i tell him to do that is my way the highway no no he says this is my beloved son i love him in whom i'm well pleased i'm proud of him i mean imagine this moment if you're jesus I'm proud of him. I mean, imagine this moment if you're Jesus. None of us can step into this, but think for a second about eternity. Your mind will blow a little bit, but think about eternity. God, the Spirit, and the Son are all in relationship, perfect relationship with one another from forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever. That's how eternity works. They've been in relationship. And then all of a sudden, when Jesus comes to earth, you know what happens? He is somehow still God, but also 100% man. He is now cut off in some ways from his father, from the spirit. And what an amazing reunion it is in Matthew chapter three, when he sees he's being baptized and he sees the heaven open. And the persons of God that he has been eternally united with are actually there now in heaven. This, or on earth, this is the moment that back in heaven they've planned forever and ever and ever. This is the moment that we're going to save humanity. This is the moment that my ministry begins and everything points to the cross and leads to our redemption. And they're all three right there again. They have a type of relationship that you and I cannot fathom or understand. They have perfect relationship. They have perfect relationship. And that's the thing. The father doesn't just have perfect authority over Jesus. The father has a perfect relationship, and that's the thing. The Father doesn't just have perfect authority over Jesus. The Father has a perfect relationship with Jesus. And here's why this matters. This matters because if Jesus, we have no other king like him, you just sang that, all hail King Jesus, if the king is willing and able to submit himself to the perfect authority of the father, who are we to resist that authority? Who are we to speak out and say, no, no, no, not your will, my will be done. For many of us, submitting to the authority of the Father is very difficult. For many of you, you have a lot of questions for God. You think about the way that your life has gone. You think about, maybe it's not your life, but the lives of others around you. You see pain, you see suffering, you see death, you see cancer in three-year-olds. And you hear of this God who exists, that's a good, loving God, who's all-knowing and all-powerful. If an all-loving and all-powerful God, an all-knowing God knows about the suffering and then loves those people, how would he not use his power then to save those people? Why is there still oppression? Why is there still slavery for most of the world? Why do these things happen? God, how can you allow this to happen? For many of us, when we think of God in that way, even in those very drastic ways in which I just painted, but even in just the day-to-day ways where we say, well, I know you want me to spend my time, money, energy, effort on these things, but I'm gonna just binge Netflix for 17 hours. We don't like that authority. We don't naturally submit ourselves to authority. We don't do it. And it's not just us. It's not just our culture. If you go back to the very beginning of this book, which is actually a really old book, what happens? They rebel against the authority of a God who has given them literally everything and has gifted them perfection and all they have to do is just dwell with God and they still mess it up because they don't want that authority over them. Because here's the truth. This is the truth about humans. Submitting to authority is difficult without a relationship but this is the key right here you see that the reason that Jesus is able to submit himself underneath the authority of the father if anybody had a reason to not submit himself right it would be Jesus and yet he still does it himself underneath the authority of the father if anybody had a reason to not submit himself right it would be jesus and yet he still does it he still submits himself why because he knows his father he knows his father is good he's sitting there in the garden about to be brutally murdered murdered for something he didn't do, complete innocence. And yet he says, not my will, yours be done, because he trusts that his father is good. He has a perfect relationship, and therefore he has no problem submitting to that perfect authority that God has over him. So what must be the problem then for us? Why do we have so much problem submitting to his authority? It is because we do not know God like Jesus knew God. We don't know him. And this is what Jesus came to do. He knew that we didn't know God. He knew that our sin had separated us from God. And so he came expressly. He agreed to this plan so that you could have a relationship with the Father, so you could get to know him. This is Jesus' express purpose, and it's honestly the biggest complaint he has when he is here on earth. I don't know if you've noticed this. Does anyone know who's the biggest enemy of Jesus in the Gospels, in all the stories? I heard it. Great job. Great answer. It was the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the religious leaders. job. Great answer. It was the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the religious leaders, his greatest enemy. And he goes off on them multiple times in almost every gospel account. He goes off on them. Like there's some of you in the room. How many of you like to set people off? You can admit it. It's like, you know, you know, think about it, especially like your dad, think about it. You know the buttons to push, right? And you love Thanksgiving dinner when you just have like 17 grenades in your pocket. Like you're like, all right, which one is it going to be? Is it going to be like LeBron's better than Jordan? Just hear this rant go out. Is it going to be that Taylor Swift's Heiress Tour is better than the Beatles ever were? Like, dude, you want to hear a boomer lose their mind? Just whip out TikTok and just let your four-year-old scroll TikTok for like 30 seconds in the front of their grandparent, and the grandparent's just going to be like, just flipping tables, casting the phone into the abyss, calling it the devil. Like, it's fun to watch. It's like a train wreck, right? It's like, man, that guy is going off. And it's fun to watch. And I, some of, there's a weird part of me that loves reading some of the gospel accounts because Jesus somehow does it, like, perfectly. Like, he didn't sin, so somehow he didn't even sin when he did these things and so there's no like you're sort of watching like yeah i mean that's a that's a straw man that's a terrible argument whatever there's none of that it's like oh he is so right and he is so angry and he is so perfect and how he's angry and he's still loving at the same time and he's just like crushing their souls because he's the only one that can actually lift back up their souls. What is happening? It's this beautiful thing. He's just going off. And in John 7, he's in the middle of one of these rants and he just says this. He says, you do not know him. He's talking to the Pharisees, but I know him because I'm from him. And he sent me. He is angry at these people. Because they are taking the system that he wanted to be made for justice, and they are using it to oppress people. They took this system that was meant to point them to the love and mercy that he has and show the whole world that i am god and they are taking that system and they are holding it over people's heads and they are using it to get rich themselves and he's just calling them out saying you don't get it he's later here in John 8, he's like, if you knew the Father, you would recognize me. But you don't know God like I know God. You don't know how good my Father is. You don't know the plans that we made way back when to not oppress you and hold you to your sin and say man you have to pay for this we wanted to buy you back from your sin that's why i'm here that's the plan and yeah you may not understand why there is so much wrong with our world but if you would just get to know my dad I do not understand why there is so much wrong with our world. But if you would just get to know my dad, you wouldn't have answers, but you'd have somebody sitting there right next to you in the midst of your pain, in the midst of your struggle, in the midst of your worry, in the midst of your fear, you'd have a dad who will never leave you or forsake you. He's right there. This is our father. And we squirm out from underneath his authority because not anything about him is bad because we don't know how good he is. But if this is, if this is Jesus' main goal in coming was to build a bridge so we could have relationship. The perfect relationship that he has with us. And if his main complaint against us is that we don't know him, what's the obvious next step for us? We have to get to know the Father. We have to. For many of us, you spent most of your life trying to figure this out. And so in a 35-minute sermon, I don't think I'm gonna revolutionize all these things, but I do wanna give you some, I don't know, some handles to grab onto to try to start understanding how we are to relate to god as father how should we relate to him as father this is very easy for me to try to figure out how did jesus relate to him i want to give you three things, three ways that you can relate to God in the ways that Jesus did. And because Chris didn't preach last week, he's not preaching in the next three weeks, I wanted to make sure that those points were alliterated and a little cheesy. So they all start with O. It's going to be great. I'm just joking. You probably are here because you you love chris and i do too i just want to make fun of him it's like he's over there he can't say anything right now i have the mic it's fine okay so how did jesus relate to the father first he related to him often if you track with him through the gospel account he's always talking to the father he's always relating to him he's just consulting him at any moment he gets up super early in the morning to go be with his father after long days of ministry he goes onto a mountain and prays so late that he has to walk across the ocean to get better the sea to get back to his people because he was just up there talking to God he prays when he has difficult decisions to make he prays when he's under extreme distress like in the garden he's always talking to his father he prays when his best friend dies he prays just in the middle of a conversation with some other people he'll be like yep father glorify your name it's like what is he doing he's like he's always relating to the father he's always talking to him is that how you relate to the father how often do you spend time with jesus how often do you read the words that the father has written for you to know him better how often do you sit and talk to God and express the things that are going on in your life and making your requests known to him how often do you cast your cares on him because he cares for you. We don't do this often enough. We sit and want control over our lives. And we strive and we strive and we strive and we strive. And I'm telling you, there's someone who cares for you. Your father is there just wanting you to consult him because he's the one who's actually in charge. All of our strivings are doing nothing. In a moment, you can cast your care on him and he can pick that burden up and comfort you in it like no one else can. We've got to get into the regular habit of any moment any day any time relating to the father and just talking to him and being aware that he's even there we don't just need to do it often we need to do it obediently i already sort of painted this picture of jesus in the garden or in the lord's prayer and all these places he's submitting himself to the Father, even to the point of death. But think about this. He submitted himself in obedience to the point of life. Do you have any idea what it would be like to be an eternal God and then have to wear a diaper? and then have to wear a diaper? He stepped out of eternity to experience what we experience with thirst, pain, hunger, getting tired. He was obedient to live in our world. He was obedient to live in our world. And I don't want to come down on us and make it feel like, man, we should be better or guilt trip you, but how obedient are we to the things that we know God has called us to do? How obedient are we just to the commands of Jesus? There's so many things in our lives that are separating us from him. And this is not, it's not to say stop doing bad things. It's to say you're ignoring the best thing. If we would listen to his word and apply it to our lives and do what it says, we enter into this relationship of obedience and submission to the person who actually created this world and ordered it in a certain way. And wants us to have good things. And when my children disobey, when they disobey and then don't even repent, they just keep time after time that I tell them what to do. I keep trying to correct them and they just keep ignoring and rebelling and rebelling. They are no less my children. But it drives a wedge between my relationship with them. It just does. And the same is true of us when we allow sin to be present in our lives again and again and again. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from those things. Step into that righteousness today. Step into that freedom today. Remove the wedge between you and the Father. He's standing there waiting for you to come back. The last way that Jesus relates to his father is he relates to him openly another way to say it but it doesn't start with O is honestly he's honest with the father you see him in moments of great distress just pouring out his heart I mean if you hear you hear his voice as you read the gospels, like he is angry at moments. He's crying out to his father. He's allowing himself to just like be as honest as possible. And some of you, I think you're afraid to actually talk to God because you're so mad. You're so frustrated. You're so confused. You have all these emotions and you choose not to talk to him, not to relate to him because you're afraid of those things like he can't handle it. He can handle it. He's the only one who can. That burden that you're carrying and trying to carry alone, it's like nothing to him. He would love to take it. First Peter says, when we draw near to God, he draws near to us. Some of you got to get over this, draw near to him. You don't have to draw near and use like King James language to pray and like be all buttoned up. Be honest about where you are. And he's right there. This is how Jesus relates to the Father. This is how we need to relate to him. If Jesus can submit to the Father's authority, I think we can too. I just think we need to get to know him better. And that's what's next. What's next for us is to get to know the Father. And that's what's next. What's next for us is to get to know the Father. For me, this journey for me where I feel like I've stepped into a better understanding of who he is as Father, started when I lost my father. So October 6th of 2020, my dad was diagnosed with leukemia. October 9th of 2020, my dad was diagnosed with leukemia. October 9th of 2020, he died. October 11th is my son's birthday, and we had a birthday party that we were having at our house, and I just needed some space. I was like, okay, people are coming up. We're going to still do this thing because I think that's right to still have Eli's birthday party. Arrangements are being made, all this stuff, but we still wanted to have his party. Arrangements are being made, all this stuff, but we still wanted to have his party. But I just needed to get out of the house for a little bit. And so it was a Sunday morning and I came here. I snuck in the back and I snuck back into that back corner and I broke. I lost my father. And I was so sad. And I was reliving all these moments that I had had with him and grieving the loss of moments that I will never have with him here on earth. And my son's birthday is that day. All this is going on. It was COVID. Like I didn't even see him in the hospital. You weren't allowed in there. Like the last conversation I had with my father in person was terrible. We were in an argument. It was this devastating moment for me and I broke. But there was someone who was there for me. And it was the Father. And though I didn't get any answers to the questions of why, I at least had someone sitting there with me in the pain. And the voice that I heard and the voice that I keep going back to every day when I go to him in prayer, the voice that I keep coming back to and hearing, it goes something like this. Chris, you're my beloved son. I'm so proud of you. Keep going. When you trip, get back up. I'm right here. Confess your sin. Go. Move. I know you keep getting to know me and someday I hope to hear I hope to I hope to get to heaven whatever that looks like and I don't know if it's going to look like you know the heavens open and a dove comes and descends on my shoulder but i know that some moment there will be this thing that hebrews says like we see right now dimly through a glass but someday we'll see him face to face i know that someday i will see him face to face and i'm going to hear some version of this this is my beloved son i'm so proud of you but it won't be the first time i will be hearing it and i won't be hearing it from a stranger I will be hearing it from this person who's been cheering me on the rest of my life however many days I have left on this earth because my father is always here do you know that father if you do not at all get to know him. If you're wrestling with God and who he is and what that means in your life, get to know him. Talk to someone here who would love to help you do so. Pursue this. It's worth everything. Let me pray. Father, it is a privilege to call you by that name. I am so grateful for how you have loved me so much to send Jesus. Jesus, who not just died for my sin, but died so that veil could be torn in two in the temple and we could be one with you. We could have a relationship with you. There's no longer a barrier between us because of what Jesus did. I pray that we would take advantage of that relationship. We would take advantage of the opportunity we have to get to know you personally. God, give us the strength to be honest about where we're at. Give us the strength to set aside the sinful patterns in our lives and give us the strength to just remember you on a regular basis and start relating to you the way Jesus did. And I pray for anyone this morning who needs to hear this, who needs to hear that God has claimed you today. You are his child. He loves you and he is so proud of you. Embrace him. We thank you for the opportunity it is to be your children and we pray in your son's name jesus amen amen."}]}

I tell people, when you think about Fearless Woman Camp, I want you to think about it being an exclusive event. I mean, obviously, it's for women only. It's for women that are age 16 and above. So you don't have to be a member of our church to attend. So if you're watching online, we have people sometimes that have watched. One year we had a lady that watched regularly in Columbus that came and we'd love to have you join us. But I will tell you, the reason I say it's exclusive is because it really kind of focuses on one of four people so if you're a person that says you know what i i i'm a woman that really wants to connect with jesus and let's say you've heard us talk about connecting with jesus and a relationship and you're like i don't know i have i have some beliefs about who he is or maybe some religious experiences but i don't really have a dynamic relationship with jesus like where i feel like he's with me and I'm talking to him, all that kind of stuff, we'd love, love for you to go. And then also on the other end of the spectrum, some of you have a really strong relationship with Jesus Christ. And what we have seen is that events like this, like Fearless Woman Camp, helps propel and catalyze what God wants to do in this next season of your life. Or maybe you're a woman that says, you know what, i got a great relationship with jesus but i don't really have a lot of good relationships with other people that are trying to follow jesus and so this event would be a perfect event for you or maybe you say i've got those but but i'm really not connected with my purpose do you know god has something he wants you to do in this season in your life so if you're a preschool mom and you're just thankful that you're alive today we love you if you're an empty nester and you're just trying to navigate what it looks like to enter this new season, whatever you are, age and stage, God has a purpose for you. And this could be a weekend where you could stop and say, man, God, what do you have for me? Even if it's just for the next couple of months in this season, what is it for me? And we have a lot of people in our church, a lot of ladies for me. And this is one of my favorite groups, this fourth group that says, you know what? Those three are real for me. And I actually like to help others connect with Jesus, connect with other women or connect with their purpose. So if you are a woman, you know, falls into one of these categories, regardless of their connection to our church at all, then I want to encourage you to sign up or get them to sign up as soon as possible. The reason why I say that is two reasons. Number one is there is limited space. And every year what ends up happening is we have a waiting list, but we cannot guarantee that waiting list. So for those of you that are sitting, hey, I'll do it in a couple of weeks. The problem is you might get on a waiting list and we can't control whether you can get in because our camp doesn't take place here. It takes place at Camp Chautauqua and they have other groups and other things going on. And so please sign up for that reason. The second one is we have a lot of ladies that say, I wanna help. In fact, we use almost 50 different volunteers on this weekend and we would love for you to help, but we don't know that you're going if you don't register. And so last Wednesday, I met with the leadership team for fearless woman camp and we were talking about this week this week right here we're gonna start recruiting volunteers and leaders so you're gonna get emails and phone calls but you will not get an email you will not get a phone call if you have not registered because all we know is that you're not going and so please please sign up as fast as possible again the event takes place on the weekend of October the 13th I think everything kicks off that day about four o'clock. That's a Friday. So after, kind of if you can get off work early or out of school, whatever that may be, and then all day Saturday the 14th as well, you can go to befearless.org to find out more information. Now, men of Fearless, men of Fearless Church, I want you to make this a priority for you to make this a priority, for you to make sure your wife, your girlfriend, your sister, your daughter, your friend is able to go. Maybe that means you're watching the kids for them. Maybe that means that you are paying their way. It means you are making a priority. One guy told me last week and he said, I got this new job and I told him, I told him I wasn't available to work this weekend because we already had plans. He made a priority because he knew it was important for his wife to be there. You don't want to miss Fearless Woman Camp. So I encourage you not only to come on your own, but invite somebody you care about as well. Now, if you're a guest of ours, we're so glad that you're here. I'm so glad that you logged on today. Today is a great day for you as a guest, because as a guest, we're doing something special. We do this maybe twice, sometimes three times a year. We call it Fearless Vision Sunday. Okay, and what that means is we're gonna take some time over the next few minutes to consider who God has called us to be as a church and what he's called us to do. And as a guest of ours, it can kind of help you honestly expedite your process. Like if you are looking for a church, this could be that Sunday where you're like, great, thanks for sharing. This is definitely not my church. And that helps. That helps. Finding a church is hard. Or you might hear something today and say, man, I think I need to take another step. I don't need to just watch and stay on the sidelines. There's something I need to do to step forward in this. Now, people that attend Fearless regularly will ask me this question. It's a great question. Why do we do this? Like, why not have a regular message? Typically, we open a passage of scripture and we address a particular passage of scripture or a particular topic on a Sunday morning. Why take away an entire sermon or message for vision? And I would tell you that part of the reason is has to do with something, one of the wisest kings in the nation of Israel, if not the wisest king in the nation of Israel's history. His name was King Solomon. You probably recognize that name. In fact, it could be argued he's the wisest man who ever lived. And he wrote a rather famous document that you'll recognize called Proverbs. Even if you're not a Bible person or a church person, you've probably heard of Proverbs. Listen to what he says in Proverbs chapter 29. He says, when there's no vision, when there's no revelation, no understanding of what God wants us to do or where he wants us to go, the people perish. But blessed are those who pursue God's revelation. Now it's very difficult because when people don't understand what God wants them to do, who he wants them to be, it literally translates that people go unrestrained. In fact, there's another proverb where King Solomon says this. He says, there's a way that seems right unto man, but in the end, it leads to death. It leads to destruction. We all approach different things, whether it's our finances, marriage, relationships, church, whatever. And if we're not all on the same page, if we don't know what God wants us to do, we live unrestrained, unhindered lives that ultimately lead to destruction in our lives but notice what he says blessed blessed by God are those who understand and pursue pursue God's revelation pursue his way pursue his vision and it's with that understanding the Apostle Paul he wrote to an early church that he helped start in the city of Philippi and he tells him he said look as your church leader you need to understand he's leader, you need to understand. He's telling them, you need to understand what God wants you to do. And he said, I want you to make me happy. And here's how you can do that. And he says, you can do these three things. Agree wholeheartedly, love one another, and work together. Agree, love, and work together. Now, when and work together now when he talks about agreeing together if you've ever been a part of any group that has two people or more you know it's impossible to agree on everything right agree wholeheartedly what's he talking about we're not going to agree on preferences not going to agree on what you like and what i like we're not going to agree on a bunch of something he says if you're followers of jesus there needs to be a few things that you all agree on. A few, what we would call here at Fearless, essential beliefs. Things that you believe about God. So like an essential belief that we have, not saying you have to have this belief, but if you're part of Fearless Church, we believe Jesus really is the Son of God. We believe that he died on the cross. And that death on the cross actually pays for, or a big Bible word, is atones for our sin. We literally believe he rose from the grave, whether you think that's crazy or not. That is a belief that a bunch of people in this room, a bunch of people online, we agree wholeheartedly with. We have a shared belief. Now, we don't just have a shared belief. He goes on and he says that you need to love one another. In fact, Jesus went as far as to say, the world is going to know you're my disciples. They're going to know you're my followers in the way that you love one another. The apostle John, he was one of the inner three closest guys. In fact, he was called the beloved. He writes later on, years after Jesus' resurrection in a sense, and listen what he writes. He writes this. He says, so we can actually tell who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil. I always, I don't know for whatever reason whenever i read that i'm like oh man like children of the devil i don't want to be in that category and he goes on and he says this anyone who does not live righteously so look at how a person lives not a perfect life but a life that's pursuing holiness right and does not love other believers what does he say they don't belong to god loving one another is evidence of our love for God that's why Paul says like you're not only gonna have a shared belief system or essential beliefs right doctrine but you're gonna have a shared love and not just shared beliefs not just shared love but a shared mission where you work together one mind one purpose one the mission one vision and when this happens in any church, all of a sudden the byproduct is not only a strong sense of unity. We know who we are. We know where we're going. But remember what King Solomon wrote. He said, where there's no vision, people go unrestrained. We all pull the rope different directions. We don't get any advancement. He said, but blessed are those who pursue God's revelation. Blessed are those who pursue God's mission, God's vision. One body pursuing one direction, pulling the rope the same direction. And so when that happens, not only are we unified, but we're blessed by God. So with that being said, we have to ask, okay, well then what's our mission? And when people ask me, okay, what do you mean by the word mission? It's really asking the question of why. It's important to know. You know, you talk about this at school. You talk about this on your sports team. You talk about this maybe sometimes in your family or at work. Why do we exist? What's our why, right? And we say our why this way. Our mission is that we want to be fearless followers of Jesus who changed the world. So let's break that down. First of all, we. Our mission is plural. It's not just an individual pursuit. It is a communal pursuit. In fact, the Apostle Paul to the church in Corinth, listen to what he says. He says, all of you together are Christ's body. In other words, I'm not fearless church. You're not fearless church. But we, we together are fearless church. And he goes on, he says, but each of you, and you can put your name right there, Brian, Ted, Jill, whatever, you are part of it. Each of you is a valuable, significant contributor to God's mission. So we together are pursuing our mission. Now, the next part of our vision is very important. It's 100% aspirational. It's not a reality. In fact, that's why we say we want to be. We are not fearless followers of Jesus who changed the world. And what's funny is people say, well, I thought you said you are. No, no, no. We want to be, we want to be, but you're looking at one of the most messed up people in our church and they let me talk, right? And that's crazy. And the person next to you is messed up. None of us are perfect. What we are committed to is pursuit, not perfection. We are committed to pursue being fearless followers of Jesus Christ. And some days, empowered by the spirit of God, we do a pretty good job. Other days we fail. But when we fail, we don't stay in the muck and mud of life. We get up, we wipe off our knees, and we say what God loves to say. You want another chance? Take another chance. Keep pursuing. We are committed to pursue our mission of being fearless followers of Jesus. Now, I wanna point out this word fearless. Now, some of you, as you read your Bible, you'll see within the Old Testament and the New Testament, over 100 different times, oftentimes spoken through the apostles or the prophets, God oftentimes spoken through the apostles or the prophets, God continues to speak and says, do not be afraid. In fact, the apostle Paul told his young protege, Timothy, listen to what he says. He said, Timothy, like God's not giving us a spirit of fear. Do you know that? I mean, think about how much fear drives your decisions and my decisions and what we do and do not do. He said that if you're a follower of Jesus, timidity is not part of your life. do not do. He said that if you're a follower of Jesus, timidity is not part of your life. Instead, what? Power. Not your power. The power of God. The love of God. Self-discipline. Self-control. A sound mind. These are realities of followers of Jesus. We should strive not to be fearful, but to be faithful. Think about it for a moment. Like when you're scared, what's the common response? You've heard this. You Fight, flight, freeze. No, when we're afraid, when we're afraid, we want to follow because we want to be what? Fearless followers. Fearless followers of who? Jesus. And this is so important. We're not following a denomination, a set of ideals or ideas from some man's heart or mind. We're not following a certain church. We're following Jesus. And the reason why is Jesus said this. He said, look, I'm the way. You wanna know the way to true peace, to true joy, to true hope in your life? It's Jesus, it's not getting physically healthy or having enough money or raising good kids. He says, no, no, I'm the way, I'm the truth in a world full of lives. I am the life, the abundant life you're looking for, the extraordinary life you're looking for. Jesus says, follow me. And then he says this rather controversial statement. He says, no one can come to the Father except through me. In other words, there's no way to be made right with God. The God who created this world, the God who created you wants you to know him personally. He says, I have made a bridge. I have made a way. I have made a truth. I have made a life. And the only way to get to me is through faith in Jesus Christ. So our goal, our goal, our mission is to be fearless followers of Jesus. Now that seems so like abstract, right? What do you mean fearless followers? Let's get down nuts and bolts. what does it really mean it means many people i'm in this group have made a commitment to do everything they can to think act and be like jesus to think to have the same beliefs jesus has jesus doctrine jesus beliefs are holy and perfect everything he believes about you and me and the world everything he believes about sin everything he believes about himself everything he believes about the holy me and the world, everything he believes about sin, everything he believes about himself, everything he believes about the Holy Spirit, whatever the belief may be, as we begin to learn and grow, we say, man, we wanna believe like Jesus, but we also wanna behave like Jesus. We also wanna act like him. Whatever Jesus did in the first century, we just translate that. And what did we do in the 21st century? How would he love his enemy in the 21st how would he care for the poor all these kind of things right and then b is talking about the character of christ formed in us that god would work in us to become more like jesus more kind more compassionate more just more holy more gracious more merciful all the eternal attributes of christ the characteristics of who he is the character christ formed in us the apostle paul said it this way apostle paul said that you may be conformed to the image of Christ, that when people interact with you, they find somebody that thinks, acts, and is being like Jesus Christ. But that's only half our mission, because the other half is that we would help others do the same. Why would we help others think, act, and be like Jesus Christ? Well, friends, that's how we change the world. The way we change the world is the same way the first century followers of Jesus did right after the resurrection. Moments before the ascension, Jesus tells those committed followers, he said, look, I want you to go change the world. I want you to go make disciples. Go help people think, act, and be like me. What people? All people, all nations, everywhere. Help them identify with me through the public act of baptism in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Not just that, but teach them. Teach them not just what I said, but actually teach them how to obey. Don't worry, I'm with you always to the end of the age. Come back next week and we'll talk a little bit about what that looks like for him to be with us all the rest of the age, generation after generation. See, here's the reality. The way we fulfill our mission is that we go make disciples. Our mission, our mission is we want to be fearless followers of Jesus who change the world. And as we pursue this mission together, there comes a great unity and a clarity. And remember, a blessing from God. and a clarity and remember a blessing from God. Where there's no vision, the people perish. But where God's people pursue God's vision together, they can expect God's blessing. So with that being said, well, then what's our vision? And our vision really is answering the question, what's God calling us to do? Like we understand the why, we get that, we wanna be fearless followers of Jesus, but what's God calling us to do? We believe our vision is this, that to initiate a mighty multiplication movement of God, where we become disciples who make disciples, working together to be a church who starts churches both across the street and around the world, right where we live and everywhere else is another way to say it. So what is a mighty multiplication movement of God? It is a movement of God that he can only get credit for where there's a rapid and exponential growth in the number of people that are turning to Jesus Christ. It's happened throughout the history of the world. Some of you that grew up in church probably remember this statement, man, we are going to pray for revival. It's not revival isn't a meeting you have. Revival is a movement of God where we see men and women and boys and girls radically changed by being introduced to the reality of God's grace and love and forgiveness. And they come to know Christ and their lives are changed. Not just a couple, but we're talking hundreds and thousands, a mighty multiplication movement of God. Now there are these people called global missiologists. And these people make a living studying numbers and figures andologists. And these people make a living studying numbers and figures and facts. And they go investigate and ask questions and study things. And they have studied over the last 150 years mighty movements of God. They call them disciple-making movements or church planting movements. Again, a rapid exponential growth of the church among a certain group of people, among a certain city, a certain state, a certain country, right? And they have said that mighty multiplication movements of God always begin at the fourth generation. And so if you were to visualize our vision, it would look something like this. Fearless Church is not just one church, we're a mighty movement of God. We wanna become disciples who make disciples, being a church who starts churches, reaching and trying to penetrate the fourth generation. Now, what was cool is this last spring, we took some time in the gospel of Luke, and we studied some of Jesus' kingdom teachings. And one of the kingdom principles we learned is that small can be significant. So I want you to imagine yourself right here. Imagine yourself spending maybe an hour a week. Maybe you do that for like two weeks with just two of your other friends. And the three of you are meeting at Panera Bread for coffee or lunch, dinner, whatever it might be. And your goal is to be disciples who make disciples. Your goal is to learn how to better follow Jesus, but also how do we help others follow Jesus? And after about two years, this may not seem very significant or very big, what if you multiplied again? And then what if it continued to multiply? Every two years, every person that was part of this, it may not look large, it may not look like a mighty movement of God, but in 30 years, in one generation, there'd be over 90,000 people committed to be disciples that make disciples. And missiologists tell us, when you get down to this fourth generation and this group of people who you and I don't even know, when they start becoming disciples who make disciples, it's a movement that cannot be stopped. Well, the reality is, this isn't new. This is a principle. This is a principle from scripture. In fact, the apostle apostle Paul as he was starting churches and trying to initiate a mighty multiplication movement of God he found a young leader by the name of Timothy and he told Timothy this he said you've heard me teach these things they've been confirmed by many reliable witnesses now you teach these truths to other trustworthy people who will be able to pass them on to others do you see it do you see it Paul says look I I learned these things I have this relationship with Jesus Christ. I'm growing and I've taught these things. What things? I've taught you about Jesus. Not only have I taught you about Jesus, but I taught you how to follow Jesus. And the things I taught you there, they've been confirmed by many witnesses. And in that day, the many witnesses would be people that you and I might recognize if you've been in church. Peter, James, John, other first century highly committed followers of Jesus Christ would be like, yeah, the things Paul's teaching, that's exactly what Jesus said, that's exactly how you follow him, that's great. And now watch what he does. He says, now you, second generation, I have poured into you, now you go teach. You see this? And who are you teaching? He says, you go teach other trustworthy people. Now think about it for a moment. Who's teaching the third generation? It's not the first generation. It's the second generation. And he says, these other trustworthy people, they need to be able to teach others. See, the reality is the gospel of Jesus Christ came to you on its way through you. It's never meant to stop with us. paul knew what modern day global missiologists are discovering today once it gets to the fourth generation it's a mighty movement of god that cannot be stopped so that's that's our vision is to initiate a mighty multiplication movement of god where individually each one of us somehow contribute and even if it may look like a small little meeting that you think is insignificant, as people begin to multiply and replicate, first generation, second generation, third, when it gets to that fourth generation, what we've discovered is it becomes a mighty movement of God, both individually and together as a church. So if this is our vision, what's our next faith step? Where is God leading us as a church? We believe our next faith step? Where is God leading us as a church? We believe our next faith step is to pray, to plan and prepare to start a new campus or new church in the fall of 2024. So in the spring of 2020, right at the time of COVID, we were blessed to be able to start our very first multiplying church called Fearless Church. You were sitting here with a church that said, you know what, we don't wanna just just be one church. We want to be a multiplying church. So we started our first multiplying church actually on COVID Sunday. You say that wasn't very smart. Thank you. Appreciate that. That was not the plan. But our starting day is March 15th, 2020. That's when Fearless Church started. Two years later, we were able to send out our first multiplying church. Over 50 people, Pastor Chris Volz, Pastor Matt Missler, and other leaders in our church sent out and started for Dayton. And we believe in the fall of 2024, we're gonna start our next church, our next campus. He said, well, when exactly? We don't know. Who exactly? We don't know. Where exactly? We don't know. Everybody's confidence is getting real high right now. You don't know a lot. We don't know what, we don't know how, but we know why. We know why we're called to do this. Because we're gonna what? We're gonna agree wholeheartedly with one another, we're gonna love one another, and we're gonna work together to pursue one mission and one vision. See, God has called us as a church to be like a river, not a lake. See, a lake church asks different questions. How can we increase our seating capacity? How can we get more chairs? How can we involve more people in one location? There's nothing wrong with that. But that's not who God's called us to be as a church. No, God's called us to be a river church, asking the question, how do we increase our sending capacity? How do we reach more people, train more people, and send more people? more people and send more people here's the reality a few of you are only gonna stay here a few months yes I know sometimes because of bad reasons right but most of the time we want a few of you to stay only a few months because you're being sent out a few you're gonna stay a few years and there might be a few of us to stay a few decades but eventually everyone us will be sent out to go make disciples and help start churches. Our goal, our goal at Fearless Church is not to be a mega church, but to become a multiplying church. So you gotta ask practically, okay, okay, that's cool. Chris, appreciate you sharing that. But will we actually do it? Will we actually, like if you're like, all right, fine, cool, I'm just gonna hang around and watch over the next 18 months. I'm just gonna see if this church, and I wanna give you, as I've prayed about this, as I thought about it, the official answer to this question, and here it is. I don't know. I don't know. I honestly don't know if we will or not. In fact, I know the apostle Paul says, neither he who plants nor he who waters, and only God, only God fearless church. So I don't know. We may not start another campus. We may not start another church, but I do know what we will do. We will be prepared. We will be prepared. We will pray. We will plan. We will prepare. And that preparation starts next Sunday. It starts next Sunday as we're going to dive into a new message series entitled The Movement. And some of you that have been around here before, you'll probably remember this. If not, we'll just kind of catch you up. Throughout this spring, what we did is we investigated the life and ministry of Jesus Christ according to the gospel of Luke. Now, you might remember this. Right as Luke begins his gospel, he writes these words. He says, what I've done is I've carefully investigated everything from the beginning. And this means a lot. Luke is a doctor by trade. He is also a historian. And I like to say he's an investigative reporter. He's very detailed. He wants, his concern is for the truth, for what's reality, not just what people are thinking, but like what is really happening in the culture. And he says, so after I've done that, I've decided to write my own careful account. So that's what Luke is. It's a carefully investigated account. Who did he write it to? Most honorable Theophilus. Now, who is Theophilus besides a great baby name? Write that down. Theophilus, it is a Greek name that means lover of God or friend of God. And we actually, scholars will tell you, we don't know who Theophilus is. A lot of people feel like because of this phrase right here, most honorable, that he was probably wealthy and influential. And he probably funded or paid for Luke to do this research, to be able to travel and find out this information. So he sends Luke out. I want to find out. And he says, this is the reason I wrote it. Here's this so right here. So you can be what? Certain of the truth of everything you were taught. So just like us, like they were taught things about Jesus. Now it's awesome for some people, they heard Jesus directly teach it. For a lot of people, Luke at this point was investigating. What did you hear? What did you see? What, you know, one person removed, two people removed. Let me try to write this careful account so that we can be certain of the truth. So here's what we're gonna do. In the fall of 2023, we are going to prepare to multiply, to start a new campus, to start a new church, as we dive back into Luke's sequel and actually study the mighty multiplication movement of God according to the book of Acts. Now this is how Acts starts. In my first book, and what's Luke talking about? The gospel of Luke. He says, I told you, Theophilus, there's that name again. So maybe Theophilus, his funding may be provided for everything Luke needed to do all this research. And Luke just decided to write two documents, Luke and Acts. And he goes on and he says, I told you everything that Jesus began to do and teach. So the important, the essential things to know who he is and how to connect with him until, what does this say? The day after he was taken up to heaven. And that's totally true. If you go back to the Gospel of Luke, Luke chapter 24, you'll read some of the final words say this. Then Jesus led them up to Bethany, lifting up his hands to heaven, he blessed them. While he was blessing them, what happened? He left them and was taken up to heaven. Now, this is what Luke tells us in his gospel, right? This is kind of the wrap up of his gospel, what happened in the storyline. But right before that, he says something that I believe with all my heart Luke thought was extremely important. He records a quote from Jesus. Here's that quote. He says, and this is Jesus, and now I send the Holy Spirit as your father promised, but stay here in the city until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power from heaven. See, Luke ends his gospel and introduces us in the book of Acts to the big transition that's coming. See, the gospel of Luke told us all about the person and work of Jesus Christ. And the book of Acts is gonna introduce us to the power and the work of the Holy Spirit, working in and through God's people. This is why Luke begins the book of Acts saying, remember, he was taken up to heaven only after what? He gave his chosen apostles further instructions through the Holy Spirit, further instructions empowered by the Spirit. Further instructions about the importance of the Spirit. And so if you think about Luke's gospel, think Luke is all about Jesus and his mission. Think about Acts is about the church and our mission. About the mighty movement of God being empowered, not by us, but by the Holy Spirit. And that, that's what we're going to jump into next week and kind of look at. So Luke continues as he's describing, and he picks up right around the time of the resurrection, and he says this. He says, during the 40 days after his crucifixion, so it was well accepted at that time. People knew Jesus had been crucified. And Luke wants to make sure that his audience, Theophilus, those that are lovers of God, those that are friends of God, us, anyone who ever reads the book of Acts, he says, look, I want you to understand that after he was crucified, something crazy happened. He actually began to appear to the apostles from time to time. Now, this isn't strange. You can see recorded examples of this. Luke himself recorded an example near the end of his gospel. The day Jesus rose from the grave, that Sunday morning, all kinds of crazy things happened. You can read it in Luke chapter 24 when you get home if you'd like to today. But all kinds of crazy things happened, and that evening the disciples are together in this closed room and they're like, man, I'm not sure what's happening. People are saying he's been risen from the grave. Those two guys are saying that they saw him. And then all of a sudden, Jesus shows up standing among them, right? And they're like, this is crazy. And he says, hey, peace be with you. And they say, whoa, I'm scared to death. They thought they were seeing a ghost. And this is what Luke's telling those of us that are reading Acts. He's saying not only did he appear to the apostles, but he also proved to them in many ways he was actually alive. Again, you go back to Luke's gospel and read a quote from Jesus. He says, hey, look at my hands. Look at my feet. Touch me, make sure that I'm not a ghost. Because ghosts don't have bodies, do they? As you see, I do. Again, Luke's saying after the crucifixion, Jesus showed up. He rose from the grave. He appeared to them, he proved to them, and he even talked to them about the kingdom of God. Now, we don't have all that's recorded about what Jesus said after he rose from the grave. I think we have some indication, as you read 1, 2, 3 John, as you read 1 and 2 Peter, both of those are near the end of your New Testament, near the end of your New Testament, near the end of your Bible. You read those. Some of those ideas, you're like, I wonder if that's something Jesus taught. But we do have a few final words, final things that Luke records for us in the book of Acts that he believed was totally essential and totally important because he was revealing to the apostles, Jesus was teaching the apostles, and I believe also teaching us the power behind the mighty movement of God. And that's where we'll pick up next week as we dive into this mighty movement of God. What is the power behind it? So how do we practically like join the movement? You're like, all right, I got it, Chris. We wanna initiate a mighty, how do I join that? How do we like prepare to multiply? I wanna give you three quick things. Number one, number one, what if you started praying vision prayers? Most of the time we pray prayers, God, this is what I need. This is what I want. Do this for me. What if you started praying vision prayers? Think about our vision. What if we started praying, God, bring a mighty movement to the city of Dayton. God, move in our city. Do something radical, exponential, rapid growth that people's lives are radically changed. What if we begin to commit not just to pray for our own lives, but we prayed for a movement of God? What if we started praying, God, help me become a disciple who makes disciples? You say, I have no idea how to do that. I have no idea how to help other people follow Jesus. That's fine. Start with prayer. Ask God, God, help me. You want me to do this? You want me to play part of your movement, to be a disciple of me? Help me, God. What if you started praying? What if you started praying? It's your first Sunday here. What if you started praying and said, God, why don't God you send me this reminds me of of the prophet isaiah when he receives his calling from the lord he writes this he says i heard the lord asking who shall i send and then who will go for us and probably like you and me looks around and said well it's not me i mean maybe that guy over there he seems qualified right but watch how he responds he responds. He says, here I am, send me. What if you started praying, send me prayers? Like what if we started praying vision prayers? What if we said, God, please use me and send me to initiate a mighty multiplication movement of God? What could God do? These are risky prayers. These are prayers that will change your life. These are prayers that will change your life. These are prayers that will make your life and my life externally and eternally significant for the kingdom of God. So we don't just pray vision prayers. I wanna challenge you to read Acts regularly, to read the book of Acts regularly. So here's kind of the goal. What if we read through the entire book of Acts two times before Friday, December 1st, right? And that sounds like a lot, but practically I did the math. If you take about 10 minutes a day, five days a week, that way you have a couple of days every week to catch up. And you try to read about four to five chapters a week, you will be through the entire book of Acts. And some of you have never read the book of Acts before, and that's great. You can start tomorrow. A lot of us are off school, off work, whatever it might be just block off 10 minutes and say here i go like for me i already started i've done it i'm now like my second time through or whatever just in this year and i've got a little notebook and i'm just writing down like things that i notice right now i'll write down how i think it applies you can do that or you can just read whatever it might be but i want you to know we are not going to read through the entire book of acts over the next few sundays we're not going to do that. So if you don't personally read through it, you're not going to get all that God has for you. You have to take ownership and say, okay, I want to hear God's voice. I want to see what God has to show me. So you make a commitment to read. And we're going to discover, we're going to discover the history of the first century church. But remember, it's not simply their story. It's our story as well. So yes, pray, vision, praise, read Acts regularly. And finally, plan to go. That's really strange to be in church and be like, man, welcome to our church. Hope you're planning to leave soon. Right? But plan to be sent. How are we going to initiate a mighty multiplication movement of God? Three things have to happen. Three things have to be true. First of all, we've gotta reach people. We've gotta reach people that are far from God. Your friends, your neighbors. Maybe you're in this room and you don't know what you think about God. And you don't know what you think about the Bible or Jesus, and you're just searching, and we're glad you're here, and you may take the next couple years just to search, but I want you to know our desire is to introduce you to a real relationship with Jesus Christ. It will transform your life here, now, and for all of eternity. And we want to continue to reach people to fulfill our mission. Our mission is to help people be fearless followers of Jesus. But we can't just continually reach people. We also have to train people to do what? To just follow Jesus? No. To be a disciple who what? Multiplies and makes disciples. Why would we do that? Well, why do we exist as a church? What's our mission? To be fearless followers of Jesus who change the world. We wanna reach people, we wanna train people to be disciples, who make disciples, who work together to be a church who starts churches. Like if we are ever going to initiate a mighty multiplication movement of god we've got to do three things we got to reach people we got to train people and we have to send people one of my friends recently had his son graduate from basic training and you know what's interesting about the united states military i've never been honored or blessed to be able to serve in any branch of the military but i've had friends and family to, none of them show up to basic training thinking that's where they're gonna stay. None of them. And the ones that do, they're sorely disappointed because a few days at the end of basic training or right after it or whatever, they get something called orders and they are sent. Let me tell you something. A lot of churches are all about reaching and teaching. churches are all about reaching and teaching. And we will try to do our best to teach, but training is different. Training is different. I want you to know, you are the church. This building is not the church. If you want to get technical, this is the service department of Planet Ford. I mean, that's basically what it is. And we put some chairs and carpet in the room, right? But the next time you show up to church, the next time you log on, what if you said, no, no, no, no, I am going to the training center. What if you had a mentality, not that you're going to stay forever. What if individually you thought, no, no, no, I'm here. I'm here to learn and to be trained to be a disciple who makes disciples both in my normal life, right across the street and in my house and all around the world. I mean, if you want me to get honest with you, all of our parent training is simply this. We want to train you as a stepdad, as a mom, as an aunt, uncle, grandpa, whatever. We want to train you to be a disciple who makes disciples in your home. We're trying to help train you to help your kids think, act, and be like Jesus Christ. I mean, it comes right back to our vision and our mission. It's not just something we do individually, but we do collectively, we work together. Our goal is to send out teams. Sometimes it might be four or five people. Sometimes it might be 50 people. Sometimes it might be 500 people that we send out on one Sunday to go out and to start a new campus, to start a new church, to do whatever, to continue and to propel the mighty movement of God. And you say, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Chris, you're crazy. If we send everybody, we ain't gonna have nobody. That's true. That's why we have to continue to reach people. If somebody asked me, Chris, are you concerned that we reach more or send more? My answer is yes. If we are ever gonna be a River Church, we have to flow. We have to continue to reach your friends, family, neighbor, to reach you, but not allow you just to say, oh, this is kind of a cool church, but to train you, to train you, not just to know some information and impress people, but to train you to go out and change the world, to train you to be a disciple that makes disciples, to train you to have an extraordinary, eternal impact with your life, and then send you. In just a few moments, I will wrap up by saying, hey, how about now, now, now, let's go be fearless and change the world. That's another way for me to say you're being sent. So if this is what God's vision is for our church, then all of us have to plan to go. Apostle Paul said, man, you need to agree wholeheartedly with Israel. You need to have shared beliefs. You need to have shared loves. And you also need to have a shared mission, a shared vision. You need to know what your mission is. You need to pursue the vision God's given you. And you need to take the appropriate next steps to pursue that. Will we start another campus or church in the fall of 2024? Again, I don't know, but I believe with all my heart, God is telling us to prepare to multiply. Fearless Church has never been about one church. It's never been this goal to simply sit and survive, but to advance, to take new ground. Not one church, but a multiplication movement where we become disciples, but to advance, to take new ground. Not one church, but a multiplication movement where we become disciples, we make disciples, we're going to be a church who starts churches. What would it look like for you to join the mission? What would it look like for you to embrace the vision? Do you know God wants to use you to reach people you will never know? know God wants to use you to reach people you will never know. God wants to use us to start churches in places we will never go. It's a vision that's not about you. It's not about me. It's not about fearless church. It's about the heart of a loving God that desires every tongue, every tribe, every every nation to come to know him. And he says, Jesus said this, we are a body that advances and the gates of hell will not stop us. Gates are defensive. As a follower of Jesus Christ, this is not a passive, wimpy little thing. This is bold men and women and boys and girls empowered by the spirit that charge the enemy's territory to rescue people that are lost and dying and going to hell. We get to be part of this mission. Is it great that you're having a kid? Yes. Is it great that you're about to get married? Great. Is it great that you're about to buy a new house or retire or whatever your next step? Those are all awesome things, but god has made you more for than just surviving he has made you to make an eternal impact that your life your life changes their lives because friends you know this already there's somebody you don't know you don't know their name you don't know their story but one day they caught a vision and they believed it was worth their life to disciple somebody who discipled you discipled you and all of a sudden you got a Roger Irvin in your life that's introducing you to Jesus Christ praise God for the men and women the generations before us person to person nation to nation generation to generation the mighty multiplication movement of God that started in the first century in the book of Acts continues in the 21st century to the ends of the earth. And God doesn't want you to miss it. He wants you to be part of this. And where, when we pursue God's vision, when we align, there's a great unity. But remember, there's also a great blessing from God, a blessing from God. Where there's no vision, the people perish. Where people pursue God's vision, there is blessing. And when we pursue God's vision, we have to trust, trust there's no vision, the people perish. Where people pursue God's vision, there is blessing. And when we pursue God's vision, we have to trust, trust God's provision. Right now, you might be thinking of all the reasons why you can't do this. That's fine. What if you just let go of that and you started trusting him? Part of trusting God's provision is to trust that he'll provide the resources we need. One of the resources I've seen him time and time again over the last three years was to provide amazing leadership within our church. We have amazing community group leaders that faithfully serve to try to help us learn how to love one another. We have amazing ministry team leaders. And you may say, I'm a ministry team leader. I don't think of myself as amazing. I just want you to know God's doing amazing things through you. It's according to his power at work within you, not your power. We have an amazing church staff. We have an amazing group of elders that oversee and shepherd and care for our flock and pray through things like this. Is this what God's called us to do? Not to be one church, but to be a multiplication movement. And today it's my honor to share with you, we are adding a man to our elder body. His name is Stephen Julie. In fact, Stephen, if you'll go ahead and make your way up here, and there's a couple elders in the room, if you'll make your way up here as well. I wanna tell you that I believe, I believe Stephen is just one part of God's provision for our church family. That God's gonna use him to help train us. Professionally, he trains business leaders, but then personally in his ministry, he trains people like me to be better leaders and to be people that multiply and understand how to help others be better. Stephen and Judy, they started attending our church during COVID. And so on COVID Sunday, they couldn't come in the room because we weren't allowed to come in the room. So they watched online for multiple months. And then I met he and his lovely bride in July of 2020. We met at an exploring membership type thing where we're talking about what it looks like to get involved at Fearless Church. And we began to build a friendship. They began to serve shortly thereafter as community group directors to make sure we have strength and health within our community group system. They have served as foundation group leaders. So again, if you are married three years or less, we have a meeting coming up Tuesday, September the 12th. You need to be there because you want to say, how do we as a married couple do things God's way? How do we lay a foundation to be disciples that make disciples? They've also been part of Regen. And so I was part of Stephen's Regen group. And so I want to take a moment to share with you some of his sin struggles that you needed. No, I'm just kidding. What's said in group stays in group. Thankful for me, especially. But I just watched a man that had a desire, a desire to pursue Christ. Not perfect, but pursuit. And so over the last year, we've spent a lot of times praying and talking with Stephen, talking with some of you. You've been kind enough to meet with us and talk with us. We sent out church-wide emails, some of y'all know, over the summer, okay, let us know. We wanna know because it's an important role. And today what we wanna do is we wanna officially recognize and install Stephen Julian as our next elder. And so the way we do that is both through congregational affirmation. So your act of affirmation is really simple. I'm just going to ask you to stand with me. And then elder confirmation. And so in the New Testament, when a new leader, when a new elder was being installed, they would bring them before the body and they would lay hands on them. And that sounds really funny. It sounds like something you would do in a gang, right? We're going to lay hands on you, right? Very entertaining, but that's not what that we're going to do. Instead, laying hands was just simply the leaders of the church would surround them and put their hands on them and pray for them. So we are going to pray for Stephen. I've asked Dave if he would lead us in a prayer, and I'm just going to ask you to pray as well. If you want to, sometimes I do this when I'm in your situation. I just lift up my hand just kind of praying. You don't have to do that if that feels strange. But just all of us together praying and saying, God, like this is a special moment, a significant moment as we install and recognize part of your provision in the leadership and oversight of our church. So Dave, if you'd lead us, that'd be great. side of our church. So Dave, if you'd lead us, that'd be great. Heavenly Father, I want to thank you first and foremost for the work that you've done in Stephen's life, for being the God who saved him, who called him, and then placed on his heart this desire for leadership. Lord, as we've gotten to know him over the past year and a half or so, it's just been a pleasure to see just the way that you have worked in him. Lord, I pray that you would continue that, continue that effort of placing in him a boldness, a desire to not be swayed, but instead to stand firm on your truth. Lord, I thank you for the elder team here at Fearless, for their desire to be led ultimately by you and not by any one person's personal desire or whims. So Lord, as Stephen enters into this new phase of life kind of here at his church, I just pray that you give him a boldness when he teaches, give him a boldness when he meets with people one-on-one, as he counsels, as he encourages. Help him to just be an integral part of what you're building as we do start this kind of intentional season of growth here at our church and multiplication here at the church. I pray that in everything that we do, that you are glorified ultimately. And I thank you once again for Stephen Julian. In your name we pray, amen."}]}

The song is \"Go Tell It on the Mountain.\"\n\nAs many of you know, \"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" is an African-American spiritual that dates back to the 19th century. It was sung by slaves in the fields, and it was a song of hope and joy in the midst of suffering and oppression. The song speaks of the good news of Jesus' birth, and it encourages us to share that news with others.\n\nThe song begins with the words, \"Go tell it on the mountain, over the hills and everywhere. Go tell it on the mountain, that Jesus Christ is born.\" This is a message of hope and joy that is meant to be shared with everyone, regardless of their circumstances. It's a message that speaks to the heart of the Christmas story, which is that God loved the world so much that he sent his only Son to be born as a human being, to live among us, and to save us from our sins.\n\nThe song goes on to say, \"While shepherds kept their watching, over silent"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The light that gives light to'm gonna let it shine.

What I want for Christmas is Nine ladies dancing eight mazes Belly-kiki-paka is the wise way to say I want to hit the bottomless for Christmas Only I'm the bottomless Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la Tis the season to be frosty The Snowman was a happy jolly song with a corn pop pipe and a hula hoop We can hardly stand the blue Christmas without you I'll be so blue thinking about Grandma got run over by The little Jesus A sleep on the night Hey Santa, hey Santa Oh, bring us some figgy pudding Oh, bring us some figgy pudding Oh, holy night The stars are brightly shining. It isn't last Christmas. I gave you my heart in the very next day. I wouldn't touch you with a 39 and a half foot pole. It is so hard to follow those two acts to come out here and share, but I'm gonna try something. I'm gonna try something. We're pregnant. Yeah, not really, not really. You see, I just want, my wife's in this, she didn't know I was going to do that. So I really just wanted to share some good news. And I thought that would be a shock to everyone. Some of you are not surprised because I have six kids. You're like, what's another, right? So, but no, we're not pregnant, but hey, maybe I should have just started with, you know, good news, what we all share sometimes. We're pregnant. We will share we're pregnant. Hey, I got the new car, right? Or we're married, she said, yes. I graduated, no more school. I got the job and I'm healed. Like we love to share good news. We love to hear good news. We love, it gets us excited. We just love good news. But if your life is anything like mine, good news becomes old news pretty quickly. Like you may get to, we're pregnant and you don't even get to the baby stage, right? Because you hit morning sickness and it's just old. It's old quick. Or the new car becomes old news when you have to upkeep it. You gotta get oil changes, pay payments, insurance. We're married becomes old news when you have to upkeep it. You gotta get oil changes, pay payments, insurance. We're married becomes old news pretty much after honeymoon, right? Life after honeymoon. I graduated becomes old news quick for any graduates coming up this year. It just gets old. When you get to work, nobody cares that you graduated. New job becomes old news really quickly when it's an everyday job. And I'm healed becomes old news really quickly when it's an everyday job. And I'm healed becomes old news when you have to continually do treatment after treatment, go to the doctor after doctor, and maybe live a little differently than you did before. It becomes old news. And sometimes in my life, and I'm assuming everybody in here has experienced it as well, old news or good news becomes bad news sometimes. Maybe we're pregnant leads to we lost the baby. Or a new car is I got in a wreck with an uninsured motorist. Or we're married may lead to we're divorced. Or I graduated, I can't find a job because of the economy. The new job, I got fired. Or maybe I'm healed leads to its back. You see, good news doesn't stick around in my life that much. Good news fades pretty quickly. But if we could find some good news, if we could find some good news that remained good news, well, that would be great news. That would be great news. And so today, as we're thinking about good news and what we can share, we're going to be talking about go tell it on the mountain. Because if there is some great news or some good news out there, we should want to share it. I mean, we share it all the time on Facebook. And when we get home, we're like, hey, some great things happened today. But if there is some news that remains good news, we should be sharing it all the time. But news in our life becomes old and sometimes bad. So we're gonna take a look at Go Tell It on the Mountain, but we need to really know the history of the song before we get into the scripture that it's based off of. You see, Go Tell It on the Mountain was written by John Wesley Work Jr. Now, John didn't actually compose it or write it. He just penned it. You see, John Wesley was a black man. His dad was a choir director at his church, and he loved music so much that he heard these songs, and he wanted to pin them down, help them remain in history for his people, the people that were growing up in this culture. You see, this is actually an African-American spiritual song, which was likely derived from an oral tradition. You see, what it was, was it was sung by a group of people that you and I would agree that probably didn't have a lot of good news. They experienced oppression, slavery, difficulties in life, and this is sung from plantation to plantation about the good news. These people didn't experience good news. They sung about it. So I don't know where you are in life today. I don't know if you came in here with just bad news, just all over you. I don't know if you came in here and you've got great news that you love to share or you're worried that this great news becomes bad news. I don't know where you're at. But today I can guarantee you there is some good news out there that remains good news, and I hope to share that with you today. But just like the history of the song where we see some people that are oppressed sing about good news, we need to know about the historical setting that Luke writes about. You see, not only are we wanting to learn about good news but the the nation of Israel is waiting for good news like this is during a time that Matt shared about two weeks ago where there is 400 years of silence he's from God there's there's nobody coming and talking from God they don't hear from God in fact they come and King David in the past was, man, the nation of Israel was very prosperous. It was a good time in the nation's history. And then all of a sudden the Babylonians come in and overtake them and they disperse them and they put them into captivity. And then some of them come back to Jerusalem and they rebuild the wall. And honestly, it's just been kind of downhill since King David. They're waiting for this Messiah to come and restore them to the pinnacle that they were in King David's time. So they're waiting for this good news. Yeah, there's silence. There's silence from God. God hasn't been talking. In fact, everyone that has heard or experienced a prophet come and talk from God has passed away. Like these are generations after generations that have just heard about the stories of old. And so when you take a look and see where they are there, not only are they like experiencing silence from god but the roman empire has come in and they've started controlling the area uh really oppressing the jewish nation they've they brought in some aqueducts uh they brought in their ability to build buildings and bring in some cultural teachings and and all that and and with that taxation to its people. So the Roman empire at this time was 65 million people. And so this is where we are in this moment in history that the Jewish nation is being oppressed by another nation. And this Roman emperor named Augustus decreed that a census should be taken throughout the Roman empire. You see the Roman emperor said, hey, we need to know how many people \"'are actually in our empire \"'so that we know how many to tax, \"'what to tax, what to expect, \"'so we can continue to prosper us and grow and conquer.'\" And so they declared all 65 million people to go back to their own ancestral towns to register for a census. And so 65 million people, if you weren't born in or lived in the town of your ancestors, you had to go back to this town. So think about it, think about it. You're being oppressed by a group of people, a government that's wanting you to go and travel from your hometown to maybe some town you've never been to because this is your ancestors hometown. And you're doing this during a time that's kind of, you're not pleased with the Roman empire. In fact, there were zealots that would come up and wanna overthrow the Roman empire. And so this is a time where the Jewish people were oppressed and honestly, probably not had a lot of good news to share. So they were waiting on this good news and Luke decides to hone in on two individuals. You and I know this if you've heard the story of the birth of Jesus. He hones in on Joseph. Joseph, he had to travel because he was a descendant of King David. He had to go to Bethlehem in Judea, David's ancient home. He traveled there from the village of Nazareth and Galilee, and he took with him Mary, to whom he was engaged, who was now expecting a child. So here we are in this time where Joseph and Mary are traveling with many other people, 65 million people possibly, to different homes so that they could be registered for a census. And you've got all of this happening, and they could be registered for a census. And you've got all of this happening and God has been silent for 400 years. But what I want you to see, the reason why this is coming up to good news is because God's been working in the silence all along. You see, this actually, these two verses fulfill so many prophecies that the Jewish nation would wait in anticipation for the Messiah. Because right here it says, Joseph was a descendant of King David. And in the Old Testament in 2 Samuel 7, 16, it said that the Messiah would be born from the lineage of David. And then he goes on and says, and he had to go to Bethlehem. And in Micah 5, 2, it says that the Messiah will come out of Bethlehem or be born in Bethlehem. And then it says to the village of Nazareth, he went from Nazareth. And so this fulfills a prophecy that Matthew writes about in 2.23 that says the Messiah will be a Nazarene. He will come out of Nazareth. And then Mary, who was expecting a child. You see, Mary was expecting a child and Joseph, being the honorable man he was, heard that Mary was expecting. Now, the thing is, technically he couldn't say we're pregnant, right? He could only say she's pregnant. And so what happens was Joseph wanted to divorce her quietly because he was an honorable man and he didn't want to shame her in the society that it was in at that time. In fact, he went to bed and an angel showed up and said, hey, take Mary as your wife. This is something the Lord has done. And this fulfills a prophecy in Isaiah 7, 14, that says the Messiah will be of virgin birth. And so you see this happening and all of this in two verses, like God has been working in the silence because you have the Roman empire who is demanding everybody in their empire to go to their ancestral hometown. There's ancestors hometown. And you have Joseph who was chosen by God because he's in the lineage of David. He lives in Nazareth, has to go to Bethlehem and has an honorable man to take Mary. and he fulfills prophecy. And this is the whole story before we get to what the good go tell it on the mountain is sung about. And so when we have the history of the song, the history of, of the nation of Israel and why it's good news, then we can dive in and see, hi, let's see what this song is about. So the first verse is, while shepherds kept their watching or silent flocks by night, behold, throughout the heavens, they're shown a holy light. And in Luke right afterwards, we see scripture that this starts at. And it says that night there were shepherds staying in their fields nearby, guarding their flocks of sheep. So you got shepherds. So my wife and I, we had to start a new tradition. You see, I grew up celebrating Christmas like many of you probably did. You woke up Christmas morning. You tried to beat your brothers to the tree and get to your presence and open them all first. It looked like a Christmas story on crack, right? Like it's just crazy. My wife, on the other hand, didn't celebrate Christmas at all. She didn't celebrate birthdays because of the religion she was brought up to. That's her story to tell. I'll leave it on a cliffhanger there. But in order to get together, we had to come up with a new tradition. So we celebrate the 12 days of Christmas. So on the first day of Christmas, I'm not going to sing the song because it has nothing to do with our tradition. We start reading books, reading books. So we've already read all five books. And this is one of the books we read, A Shepherd's Christmas Story. And so I want to invite you into our tradition. And I'm going to read some of this because I think this is good on our imagination to put ourselves in these shepherds' shoes. Okay? So it starts off here and it says, as soon as I get to the page, were I more than an uneducated shepherd, I would have recorded my every memory of that night, but I could neither read nor write. And perhaps that made it even more amazing that of all the people on earth, kings, nobles, religious leaders, rabbis, this message came to us. He came to us. He could have come to kings. He could have come to nobles who kept their distance from us shepherds as they streamed into Bethlehem to be counted for the census. He could have come on the call of temple priest. He could have come in clouds of holy temple fires. The visit could have come to Herod's grand palace outside the city, surrounded by gold and marble, but he came to us. You see, the angel could have showed up to anybody. Jesus could have come anywhere at any time, and he decided, the angel decided to show up to shepherds, shepherds that were of lower class, of not seen as higher class, like they were uneducated. Now, I don't know about you, but I'm not meant to be a shepherd. I want to go to bed at night in a bed, right? And if you look at here, they were just working. It's not like that they were doing something very religious at this time. They were just working. They were at night, so we don't know what temperature it was out there. It could have been cold, could have been hot, right? They were in the fields guarding their sheep. They were working. They were probably kind of in and out of, you know, that right before you fall asleep, but want to still be awake for what's going on. Like this is kind of where they are. They're doing their job. And then all of a sudden an angel shows up and they were terrified. Remember, they've not experienced God speaking. They've not seen an angel. They've only heard of it. And just like you and me, we would be terrified. We would be terrified if an angel showed up. And so the song continues on, right? The shepherds feared and trembled when low above the earth rang out the angel chorus that hailed our Savior's birth. It continues on and it says, hey, but the angel reassured them, don't be afraid. He said, I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people. The Savior, yes, the Messiah, the one you've been waiting on, the Lord has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David. So now we're getting into what is this good news? You have the Jewish people that's been waiting for the Messiah, and this good news will bring great joy, but this is where the angel does something different. If he was coming to talk to the Jewish nation, I would have assumed he would have said, hey, good news to bring great joy to the Jewish people. But this is where you and I get to enter the story. This is where we get to actually realize why this is good news, because it's for all people. You see, he continues on. He says, suddenly the angel was joined by a vast host of others. Literally the heavens opened up and the armies of heaven praising God saying, glory to God in the highest heaven and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased. Have you ever asked yourself, is God pleased with me? Or maybe have you ever asked yourself, what do I need to do to please God? What do I need to do in order for God to be pleased with me? in order for God to be pleased with me. Like sometimes this news that we continue to hear over and over and over on Christmas or Easter, like some, it's just confusing. Like if I think about my kids, I want them to obey me, right? And I want them to kind of do what I say is to be pleased with them. So do we need to do something that God wants us to do in order for him to be pleased with us? What do we need to do? You see, the angel could have spoken to religious leaders trained to understand revelations. Not there yet. It's kind of hard to read and click at the same time, right? Wiser men might have known how to recognize the savior but the angel understood our ignorance this will be a sign to you you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger you see god is very good at explaining himself he's good at explaining himself in scripture sometimes it can be confusing but the bible's clear on what pleases god and that is perfection like a holy god demands perfection those that are within his presence needs to be perfect and so when you look at it romans says that when we uh sin we fall short of god's standards see he was clear on what pleases him. In fact, he writes it down, like, don't lie, don't steal, don't commit adultery, don't put any gods before me, honor your father. Like, he's really good at making it clear what we should do. But the moment you and I don't do one of those things, we become imperfect. And so we have no hope to stand before a holy God because that is what he desires, perfection. Now, that doesn't sound like good news. That sounds confusing and bad. In fact, it goes worse. Like he says, but for the wage of that, for the wage, what we earn for our sin, for our disobedience, for our imperfection is death, eternal separation from God. And so that's even worse news. But then the verse goes on and says, but the free gift of eternal life is through Christ Jesus, our Lord. We get something from Jesus. And the way we get it is by confessing with our mouth that Jesus is Lord and believing in our heart that God did raise him from the dead. He says, you will be saved. You'll enter into this relationship. And not only that, at that point, when we enter into that relationship, he starts dwelling in us. It says that the Holy Spirit tabernacles dwells with us so that the same power that that's part of the red sea that that um went on mount sinai that did the burning bush all of those stories that he'll deem that didn't heal demons drove out demons and healed everything else that same power lives inside of us. He is with us. And so when we talk about God with us, this starts being good news for us. And once we have him in us, then we are seen as righteous. Not because of something we've done, but only because of what Jesus did on the cross. And so that's how we are pleased with God. You see, the angels returned to heaven and the shepherds said to each other, let's go to Bethlehem and let's see this thing that has happened. See, they believed it was God speaking through the angels, but it's still just news to them. It's still just possibilities, which the Lord has been told. So they hurried to the village and found Mary and Joseph, and there was the baby lying in the manger. You see, the angel music could have come to temple singers trained to join in. And then all of a sudden the angels were gone, slipped behind the veil of heaven, leaving stars as shadows of their glory. And there was no one but us. Silence was broken by the voices of my elders. Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about. He told us. You see, the Savior could have been born in the temple of Jerusalem, where we take our best, our perfect lambs for sacrifice. The aroma of incense could have blessed the air. But I remember the smell of hay mixed with donkey sweat and cows. And I love that. I love that sentence right there. Because we don't think about that. And there in a manger was a child, small and wrapped in strips of cloth. The Lamb of God, come to us. You see, the shepherds the shepherds experienced news, but it didn't become good news until they saw Jesus. It didn't become great news until they experienced Jesus. In fact, this is why the third verse says, down in a lonely manger, our humble Christ is born and brought us all salvation that blessed Christmas morn. He brought us all salvation. This is great news. And you can't experience the great news without experiencing Jesus. You see, after seeing Jesus, him, it became something different. The shepherds told everyone what had happened and what the angel had said to them about this child. And all who heard the shepherd's story were astonished. You see, the good news could have been carried from the stables to the kings and queens, nobles and warriors. But I remember our joyful shouts as we shared all that we had heard and seen to the late night travelers, to the early morning bread makers, to the Roman guards at the gate. And then we returned to the hills outside Bethlehemem but something changed as they go back to this same place you see they glorified god the great shepherd who had sent us such good news to us to us to us you see jesus visited many during his stay on earth he told about a story searching for one lost sheep he said said, I'm the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep. Then he became our lamb of sacrifice, dying for our sins. When he rose again, he told his friend Peter, feed my sheep. And I believe the Savior never forgot us shepherds. We shall never forget him. You see, this is good news, but do we forget it? Do we forget that it's good news? Do we forget that it's great news? You see, there's really kind of two things going on here. You see, there's those that have followed Jesus, that believe in that, and it becomes great news. And those that have decided not yet. And so it may just be news. You see, after this story, it's amazing. Mary and Joseph takes Jesus to the temple and they consecrate him to the Lord. And a priest named Simeon says this, sovereign Lord, now let your servant die in peace. As you have promised, I have seen your salvation, which you have prepared for all people. He is a light to reveal God to the nations and he is the glory of your people Israel. So there is a group of people in here today that honestly, Jesus has not become your salvation. That this news is confusing news, or maybe it's bad news, or maybe just news, because you've heard it over and over and over. And he has yet to be revealed as the light of God to you. But there's also another set of people in here, another set of people that you've experienced salvation through Jesus. Yet, sometimes life beats us down. Sometimes life just doesn't treat us well. Sometimes we make mistakes. Sometimes we do things that honestly isn't godly. And so we feel distant from him and it becomes old news or bad news. You see, what do you say when you get home from work and someone asks you about your day? Do you talk about the great news or do you let other news overshadow the news that will always be great? What do you do with this news? Because Jesus, who is the light of the world is actually talking to his people on the side of the mountain. He says, you now the light of the world, is actually talking to his people on the side of the mountain. He says, you now are light of the world. You are light of the world. We just experienced it with the children. They came and sung this. Like you are the light of the world, like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden. No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket. Instead, a lamp is placed on a stand where it gives light to everyone in the house. No one has good news and then doesn't talk about it. In the same way, let your good deeds. How do we share the good news? Words and deeds. Literally, we fulfilled James's verse when it says, be doers of the word and not hearers only. We work out our salvation with fear and trembling, shine out for all to see so that everyone, everyone will praise, not you, not me, but your heavenly father. There is news that we are to share. And honestly, some of us today will say, I have a let life overshadow this news. And so today I just wanna ask, what will you do with it? This good news. Again, if this is just news to you and you haven't experienced Jesus yet, who will you ask? Who will you tell? Like explain to me this confusing news that I hear over and over. I just don't get it. Or if you've experienced the good news, the great news, then who will you tell? Is it worth telling? And I would say, yes. Like, we sing about it. We sang about it. Go tell it on the mountain. So if you'll stand with me real quick, we're about to share and sing again, Go Tell It on the Mount. So go ahead and stand up. Yeah, stand up. I'm going to pray so that we can actually get our spirits right before God because we have great news. The King of Kings, the Lord of Lords has come and redeemed us from that which we could not be redeemed. And we have great news to share. So Father, thank you. Thank you for fulfilling prophecy. Thank you for the Jewish people that recorded this over. And so that we can read it today and be able to realize that we were adopted, that we were brought into your story. And God, I'm thankful for John Wesley Ward Jr. that had the passion to record this song of Go Tell It on the Mountain. Go tell it everywhere. God, we have great news and God, please forgive me when I allow life to overshadow, when I allow the bad news or the old news, when I treat your news like it's just another set of news, God, this is the best news that we could ever have. And God, please transform my heart to remember that this season, we're not just coming before you to worship you again, just like any other day. We're coming before you because we have great news and we need to tell it. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."}]}

We're glad that you're here. My name is Chris Williams, and I have the honor and privilege of serving as one of your pastors. If you're a guest of ours, we want you to know all week long we've been praying, planning, and preparing with you in mind. We don't want to embarrass you anyway, so we're not going to ask you to stand up or raise your hand or anything like that, but we would love to meet you. And the way we do that is right after this service, just outside those doors to the left is an area we call the Connection Center, and we'd love for you to stop by there for one or two minutes and let us know it's your first, second, fifth time, whatever it might be. We have a gift for you, and we'd love to just help you get connected. Now, if you're watching online, if you'll go to connect.befearless.org, so connect, the word connect, .befearless.org, we have an online connection card. We'd love for you to fill that out, and we'd love to send you a gift as well. our goal, our goal here at Fearless Church is to help you connect to God, not connect to a religious system or not connect even necessarily to a particular church, but connecting to God in a personal way. And then once that occurs, that you could connect to God's people. We'd love for it to be Fearless or another local church, whatever that may be. We want to help you in your journey because there's one thing I know. I feel this very confident is that God loves you. And for some of you, I say that and you're like, man, I don't know. Does God love somebody like me? Is God even real? And that's okay. For some of you, I say that and you're like, man, I know. I know God and I know He loves me. But here's the second thing. I think God wants to say something to you today. Like while you're watching online, a personal message to you that's that's what's awesome about god's word and god's spirit and god's people as as god uses people to to stand on stages like this and read the scriptures and explain them and apply them that's god's way of saying you know i've got something personal something powerful something transformational i want to say to you so the real question for you and i is are we listening to god as said before, we'd love to answer any questions you have about connecting here at Fearless Church. We have a couple of events coming up two weeks from today. We have Exploring Serving. So some of you, that is your next step to get more plugged in through serving. Or we have some parent training coming up in November. All that stuff that we have coming up, events like that, can be found at befearless.org, our church website, and just click on the events page. And one of those events we just had this weekend, which was awesome, it was called Fearless Woman Camp. And so, yeah, awesome. So we had a number of ladies that took time out, about 24 hours away from the busyness of life. We're all busy, overscheduled probably. And they just said, let's pull away from work, even family obligations, and just get away. They went down to Camp Chautauqua about 30 minutes from here and just had some time alone with God, but alone as well with one another to connect in a more meaningful way between one another, and just God did some amazing things. And so thank you for all those that volunteered. I think we had over 40 different ladies volunteer in different roles, so thank you for all that service. I also want to say thank you to our guest speaker, Misty Carter. She did an amazing job. Give her a round of applause. And so this morning, I'm excited. We're going to do something a little bit different. I want to introduce you to a good friend of mine. His name is Pastor Michael. And Michael is actually Misty's husband. And I met them about 15 years ago. Those are, you know, I share with you guys a lot. God's going to use three things to speak to you, right? His word, his spirit, and his people. And I would challenge you, wherever you are in your spiritual journey, do you have people around you that are pushing you, that are challenging you, that are encouraging you, that are supporting you, that's sometimes correcting you? And Michael's one of those friends in my life that I can honestly say I love Jesus more, and I follow him better because of our friendship. He's one of my 2 a.m. friends. And you know what I'm talking about. Who do you call at 2 a.m. when things are not going well? To this day, it's kind of funny, he lives in Texas, but to this day, sometimes when I'm driving home somewhere from late at night, and I think, man, if I have a blowout right now, who would I call to come help me? And Michael's still on that list. I don't know if he would drive 20 hours up here, but I think he might. He'd be like, dude, if we could laugh together and have a good time, maybe so. But I am encouraged today, not just because Pastor Michael's going to share his heart, but I'm encouraged because I believe when we open up God's word, we're going to hear God's voice. So I want to encourage you right now to prepare your heart and your mind not to hear from a pastor that you've never met, Pastor Michael, but instead to hear God, his spirit, his word through his man. So let's get prepared and see what God has to say to us. Check this out. The Rabbi who asked us to come, Jesus, he lived and taught like no other. He died, but somehow even death couldn't stop him. He rose and lived again, and ascending into heaven, he made this promise to his ragtag group of followers. You will receive him when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. It was a new beginning. Anything was possible. The moment his followers were filled with the Holy Spirit. And that moment sparked our movement. An unshaken movement that stood up straight in the face of persecution and refused to be snuffed out. An unstoppable movement spreading like a fire, person to person, city to city, nation to nation. A movement that will change the course of history, that will last across every generation. To this generation this is all so here's some truth real quick before we get going chris talked about me being the 2 a.m friend he's not lying um this back when he was in Texas one night. He, I still don't really know if we know exactly what the deal was. They just said it was a pastor deal. But he got up in the middle of the night, and it may have been 2 a.m., I'm not sure, went to the bathroom and passed out. And when he came to, he literally said to Christelle, call Michael. I still don't know exactly what I would have done if she would have called me. She didn't call me, but he really did. And another fun fact before I get going here is we're about to get, or we get to the airport DFW. I get out of the car and we went by the cleaners on the way to the airport. And I get out and I open the back door of the car and I look and I'm like, whose clothes is this? So my wife is thrilled that I'm wearing, if you can't, you may, there's stains all over these things. And she's like, oh my gosh. And Chris was like, it's all good, man. Just wear it. So I'm like, okay. So off we go. So if you're looking at my jeans and you're going, why is he wearing, I'll keep doing this probably where you can't see some of them. That's why. So anyway, if you're wondering, that's the answer. So let's go. Have you ever, have you ever decided you were going to run some sort of distance? Not like when you were in school where it was like, I'm going to go, I've got to run lines or something in a sport. But where you just decided, you know what, I'm going to try to run five miles, or I'm going to go run a 5K or a 10K or something. And you don't pull it off because somewhere along the process of the training, you stop. Well, I had ran a 5K. I never really had ran other than in school. And I ran a 5K, and I decided, hey, I'm going to run a marathon. That's extreme, I know. You go from three to 26 miles. But I think, hey, I'm going to try this thing. So I start training. I start running. And halfway through the process, you have your long days. And this day, I'm supposed to run 13 miles. Well, I get around six, seven miles away from my truck, and this had not happened at all in any of this process. I start telling myself I need to stop. I'm like, man, I just need some water. I can walk for a little bit. It'll be a little bit easier. I can stop right now. You know what? I'll just run tomorrow. I start telling myself all of these things and there's even, which none of you would know this, but I'm on a loop that's outside of town and there's a Mexican food restaurant kind of a little ways and I even it's seven o'clock in the morning I'm like man I would really like to just whip in there and see if they got some food drinks anything but I mean it's ridiculous I know but my brain is running through this and here's what happened. I stopped. The first time and all of the training and everything I've been doing, I stopped. And I get to go in again. And I'm like, cause my first thought is why did I stop? Cause it only took a few seconds for it to not feel like I'm dying. And here's what happens, I can't go. I am shot, so to speak. Have you ever had a goal or something you wanted to achieve, not just running, that you wanted to do, but you didn't achieve it or get there because you stopped? Now, it's really easy to talk about like diet and exercise and things like that. I mean, most of us probably the first three years say I'm going to eat healthy or whatever. And that doesn't take very long to be in a situation where, you know, you've been eating lettuce for weeks. And then all of a sudden you have a cheeseburger or something, man, that's good, and then you just pig out, which is what I do. Again, 5K to marathon, it's like lettuce to 87 cheeseburgers. This is how I roll. But like the truth of the matter is, like if you really, really get serious about stopping and the implications, like none of us, if you're in this room and you're married or have been, none of us, when we get engaged and when we go through the I do's, go, man, you know what I want to do? Let's make it a good three years and get divorced. None of us do. That is not what we want to achieve. This is not our goal. When we go to get married and we go through this, it is, I want to spend my life with this person. I want to have kids, have a family, and we have this whole thing, but that doesn't always happen, does it? Something happens and we stop. and we stop, and we don't achieve that thing that we were wanting to achieve. The big idea or the main point today is this, is that fearless followers of Jesus don't stop. We're going to walk through, I'm going to summarize Acts 1 through 3, and this y'all have heard over the last handful of weeks. Y'all have been going through Acts. But just to make sure I catch everybody up to where we are this morning in Acts 4, I want to make sure we're all on the same page because there's a whole lot that took place, a whole lot of meaningful stuff that took place that really sets the groundwork for what happens in Acts 4. So here's what's happened. Jesus has come. He's done his thing. He's been killed. He's resurrected. And then he's telling the disciples, I'm going to send you a helper. I'm going to send you the Holy Spirit. Y'all hang out. He'll be here in just a second. Jesus goes back to heaven. Holy Spirit comes, bam, comes down on them. Peter, Peter, Peter. Who is Peter? Peter comes down and he starts preaching like crazy. 3,000 people are saved. Then a few days later, Peter and John, after this happened, they're on their way to the temple. They come to a gate. And as they're walking through this gate to go in the temple there's a lame or a crippled beggar you see later in Acts that this dude's been doing this they've been someone's been bringing him there and laying him there for 40 years so they're sitting a kid this is a grown man that this has been going on and on. This is not the first time that Peter and John would have seen this guy if they'd ever went through this area. This is not like this is this guy's first time to do this, but here's what's different this time. Peter stops. Peter prays for this guy, and when he says amen, this guy gets up, runs around runs around jumps it says he is just running amongst all these people talking about what's happened here's what happens with peter here's what peter does again he preaches to all the people that witness this again those people a lot of them have probably seen this guy before and they knew what was going on with him and now he's up running around and peter goes to preach and saying how this happened why this happened what god was doing and how god did it which lines us up and rolls us right into chapter four of acts verse one while peter and john were speaking to the people again he just got the preach another talk about it they were confronted by the priest the captain of the temple garden some of the sad disease these leaders were very disturbed that peter john were teaching the people that through jesus there is a resurrection of the dead so just real quick the sad disease one did not believe in the resurrection of the dead. So just real quick, these Sadducees, one, did not believe in the resurrection of the dead. They didn't believe in angels, demons, miracles, all these things. They were anti-spiritual type, okay? And they're confused because things are happening, and then Peter's just sitting here preaching this, so it says they're not happy. So they arrested them, and since it was already evening, put them in jail until morning. But many of the people who heard the message believed it. So the number of men believed now totaled 5,000. So just in a few days, you went from 3,000 people to now 5,000 men so add some on top of that because of women and children this is how many people are Christians or people that are believers people that are following Jesus people that are saved the next day the council of all the rulers and elders and teachers of religious law met in Jerusalem and it's the high priest was there along with Caiaphas John Alexander and other relatives of the high priest so here's what's happening they just prayed this guy's going around it's making these religious leaders crazy we see who these leaders are. Well, here is what's happening. These leaders, Caiaphas, Annas, these are the same two, along with some others, that just killed Jesus less than 100 days ago. Less than 100 days ago, Jesus is standing in front of these same people, and they're screaming, crucify him. And Peter ran. A hundred days ago when this took place, Peter leaves out and denies knowing Jesus to a servant girl. Not a religious leader. Not a Roman soldier no one of any quote unquote importance a servant girl and again this is the same Peter that had been walking with Jesus had seen all of the things all the miracles people being raised from the dead he had seen this yet people being raised from the dead. He had seen this. Yet, he leaves and denies knowing Jesus to his servant girl. He stopped. When I was running, and I got way far, far away, I was, like I said, six, seven miles from the truck, and I stopped and realized, what in the heck am I doing? And I went to go again. This is no lie. I went to start going again, and my legs did not move, and I fell straight forward, caught myself. And it really, and I joked about this earlier, but I'm sure if somebody drove by, they thought I was doing push-ups or something on the side of the road, because there's, I mean, who does that, right? And I stand back up real quick, and I'm so dizzy, I can't hardly see or focus, and my legs feel like they weigh like 100 pounds a piece. And I'm like, what in the heck happened here? And I start to go, I don't know what to do. And then here in a second, I finally get to moving, but I find out later that it's an actual medical condition. It is called exercise-associated postural hypotension, which in my world, which we would call country redneck world, it means this. You've been doing a whole lot of something for a long period of time, and your body's working really hard, pumping all this blood to get to wherever it needs to go, and when you stop, your heart slows down real fast. It doesn't know what to do, so your brain is not getting what it needs because it's pushing all this blood somewhere, So your brain is not getting what it needs because it's pushing all this blood somewhere and it literally Swells and makes your legs bigger and heavier, which is exactly what happened and I couldn't move And I'm like, what am I going to do? How am I gonna get back and I honestly thought about calling my lovely bride which many of you have met But you didn't know her or you really probably didn't talk to her before 8 a.m. Let me explain something. I would rather an 18-wheeler hit me running 80 than talk to my sweet wife before 8 a.m. This is just the truth. Especially go, honey, you're going to need to come get me. She, what? They're just not good. honey, you're going to need to come get me. She, what? That's just not good. But what happened? Why did I stop? I stopped because it got hard. It got hard, and then I started believing lies. And I kept going, and I kept thinking, and it just got worse and worse, and I just believed it to the point that I stopped. So why do we stop? Why do we stop? Well, there is a million reasons why we stop, but the three we're going to kind of screw down on are this. They are hurts, habits, and hang-ups. Here's what a hurt is. A hurt relates the pain we experience that makes us want to stop. Now, in this setting, this is very much related to being hurt by another quote-unquote Christian or the church. And I'm talking the organization of believers. Because that's what we relate to our faith, that's what we relate to Jesus, and when something in between that hurts us, it causes us to want to stop. And Toler, where I'm a pastor, this is a true story, a couple that I'd known for years, I'd been walking through some different things with them, and one Sunday morning, the toilet is running over. And somehow, someway, they're like, Michael, the toilet's running over. And I'm like, what? I have no idea yet how. I'm still, the more I even say this, why did they come get me to fix the toilet? But they did. So I'm running, and I go through the lobby, and I pass this couple. And the wife looks at me and says something and kind of waves, and I just kind of give her one of these, and I keep going. Well, I can't remember now. This was several years ago, but it was six, seven weeks goes by and I realized I haven't seen them. And this is people that were there all the time and I had known for a long time. So I called the husband. I go, hey, what's going on? Where y'all been? Are y'all everything okay? Like, is somebody sick? I mean, I really didn't know. And he goes, man. And he says his wife's name. And he's like, she's really tore up. She, like, thinks that you're mad or upset or you're tired of us or we're being a problem. All these things. All a lie. And I tell him, like, no, dude. I was trying to get to the bathroom and fix it, you know, and he's like, what? And so I tell him, and everything's fine, but this is why I tell you that story. I understand. Please hear me say this. I understand you can be hurt. People are bad. There is evil in the world. Trust me, I know this. But here's what I can tell you a lot of the time honestly most of the time there's these misunderstandings these screwed up communications and then there's assumptions that build and when they're not handled quickly they just roll and get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger, and they will cause you to stop. You have to clear it up. You have to go to that person as soon as you can and say, what in the world, and what you're going to find most of the time, it's really not that big of a deal. And again, I understand you can get hurt. I'm not saying you can't. But listen to me. You've got to clear it up, and you've got to act on it soon. And the sooner you do it, guess what? God's going to get in the middle of it, and he's going to handle it, and it's going to make everything just roll. But if you don't, you're going to get hurt, and you're going to stop. The second thing is habits. Habits relate to patterns in our life that go against God's way and make us want to stop. Now, what I want you to recognize is the word pattern in there. Because I can say habits and we can all say drugs, alcohol, porn, social media, gossip. And you can even say good habits, exercise, eating right, all these things. There's all kinds of habits. But understand the word pattern. Understand the word pattern, because the pattern, a pattern will eventually go into something that when you're pattering, your pattern will get in the way of your relationship with Jesus. I had patterns, I've had habits all of my life too that I'll share. They're no longer patterns, thank you Jesus. No longer habits, it was alcohol and tobacco. And you may go, okay, I can see that, but those aren't the same. Well, what you're doing is you're instantly moving it to the things that can come from that. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the pattern of doing anything that is coming into the place where Jesus is supposed to be. And here's what I mean. Copenhagen. I don't know if that's a thing around these parts. Chewing tobacco. Things that you don't catch on fire, okay? Tobacco that you don't burn. This was an extreme pattern. and I would wake up first thing I thought about Copenhagen as soon as I started eating halfway through my meal I'm thinking Copenhagen if somebody made me mad Copenhagen if I got stressed Copenhagen I mean you just fill in the blank anything that was out of the norm, what was I doing? I was grabbing my snuff, my tobacco. I was not going to Jesus. Now, that sounds silly, but let me just tell you the truth. That becomes a pattern that will cause you to stop. Alcohol, I say that. That's always fun to say at church. You can instantly see like, oh gosh. But here's the truth. There wasn't a time that I would drink because the pattern was not, I was not an alcoholic. I wasn't waking up, reaching for a bottle of vodka. But there was patterns of things that I was doing throughout the day, or let's say every once in a while throughout the week, that would always involve alcohol. Always. And those moments and in those times had absolutely nothing to do with Jesus they just didn't it was more about the alcohol and all of those things yes they all have things that come from them but that's not what I'm talking it's about what are the patterns in our life because here's the deal I know people that exercise that they are so about working out and exercising that that is their pattern that is their habit they're going there before Jesus they're working out three or four times a day and they're doing all these things in Christ is not the focus of their life and you've got to get away. The third thing is this. It is hang-ups. Hang-ups relate to problems that prevent us from trusting God fully. Hear the word trust. I don't know hardly any of y'all. But here's the thing. These hang-ups are what make us go, I don't know enough to talk about Jesus. I'm not going to pray out loud because I sound weird. I'm not going to go serve or do this or do that or anything to do with the church or with Jesus because if people knew, if people really knew me, knew where I've been, what I've done, there is no way they would want me doing that. All a lie from the devil. Complete lie from Satan. Because that is not what God intends for you. And those things are hang-ups that will cause you to stop, to not trust God. So the guy that's up here preaching right now, back in 2007 at our church, I got asked to serve in kindergarten boys. And I want you to know, I almost threw up. And I was just, I'm serious. I'm not, I'm being honest. I'm like, there is no flipping way. Like, I'm like, and I really thought, I don't know enough. There's no way I can lead these boys if they know what I've done. Like this doesn't make, no. And Brian Tate, y'all's Brian Tate. He's like, yeah, got a cheerleader in here. All right. Let me guess. Is that Amy? I had a girl. He's like, all right, dude, come on, let's go do this. And so we did it. And and it was and we grew together I mean I could I could talk about Brian forever but with that here's here's what happened that that little bit of a hang-up if I would have let it truly hang me up I would have stopped and I really don't know if I'd be where I am right now you have to quit believing those lies because here's the truth. Peter, Peter, Peter, again, about a hundred days prior left out and said, I don't know who that guy is. I don't know who Jesus is and didn't know I was knowing him. Now he is standing in front of religious leaders that we all know knew more than him. They could recite so much scripture and texts and all of these things. These are just some guys and they couldn't do all that. But this time they didn't stop. Why not? This time they didn't stop because they have the Holy Spirit. And they don't stop. So follow me here. Verse 7, they brought in the two disciples of the man of, by what power or in whose name have you done this? Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, rulers and elders of our people, are we being questioned today because we've done a good deed for a crippled man? Do you want to know how he was healed? Let me clearly state to all of you and to all of the people of Israel that he was healed by the powerful name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, the man you crucified, powerful name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, the man you crucified, but whom God raised from the dead. For Jesus is the one referred to in the scriptures where it says the stone that you builders rejected has now become the cornerstone. There is salvation in no one else. God has given no other name under heaven by which we must be saved. Understand, this is the same Peter that was a chicken, that denied knowing Jesus to a girl. And now he is standing there right in front of them, just bringing it and does not care. The Holy Spirit is filling him and he is going, and this is what I want to focus in on here for just a little bit. In his first 13 and 14, the members of the council were amazed when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, for they could see that they were ordinary men with no special training in the scriptures. They also recognized them as men who had been with Jesus, but since they could see the man who had been healed standing right there in front of them, there was nothing the council could say. How do fearless followers of Jesus not stop? They do those things. The first thing is this, is fearless followers of Jesus don't stop because they are bold from the Holy Spirit. They are bold from the Holy Spirit. Again, Peter, this was not him not too terribly long ago. This was not how he acted. This is not what he did. But he trusted and there was something in him that was moving him to do things that he normally would not do, that honestly he was probably scared to do. And now he's got this Holy Spirit in him that's moving him. And these are just guys. These are just guys. And this is one of the reasons why the religious leaders are so confused. These are just dudes. These are just some fishermen, and yet they're acting and talking in a way that makes absolutely no sense to them because they're just guys. When we were in Israel in July, we went into, I think we have a picture of the synagogue here. It's kind of hard to tell, but we're in this room, in this synagogue, and this is where Jesus read from the scroll of Isaiah in Nazareth. And I would do anything if I could really let you all understand what this felt like, but this room is so stinking like you walked out of it you go from super peace and just it feels so good in the synagogue you walk out of the gate and it is chaos it is so there's so many people that honestly don't look like any of us and you feel unsafe you feel threatened and it is just it's really strange like I can't all explain it I wish I could spend hours trying to do it but it is so there are so many people there is thousands of people all packed in this one in this road and they're pushing and pulling and you're just trying we have our kids there's several of us families and we're trying to get out of there well we get out of this herd after we walk about a quarter half mile and after we get out of it there's a lady that's with us and she she's weeping and she goes we've got to go back to this guy and we're like what are you talking about and she's likeeping. And she goes, we've got to go back to this guy. And we're like, what are you talking about? And she's like, did y'all not see the guy? And we're going, no, I was just trying to get out of the people. So apparently there was a guy that was right outside the gate that was laying on the ground. That leg was wide open from knee to his ankle. She's like, you can see muscles and bones and it's just oozing and all this stuff. And I'm like, I didn't see him. She's like, we have to go back and pray for him. Now this is me being totally honest. She said that and I'm like, no. I do not want to go back into that mess of people. Like, I really didn't. And the Holy Spirit in me was like, yep, you are. I was like, oh, my gosh. And then my wife, she's not the Holy Spirit. She's about to close to it. She's like, come on. We got to go. I'm like, okay. So a handful of us go back. We work through all these people back into this just craziness. We get around this guy and there's so many people. I mean, we're getting pushed and pulled and we're like circled around him and one of the ladies starts praying and true story for me again i don't even know what she was saying because my prayer was god please don't let somebody stab us kidnap us kill us Just fill in the blank. And it sounds almost funny saying it now here, but I'm not lying to you when I say I felt that way. And if you know what's going on over there right now, it's a dangerous place. So I pray that to myself. I say, you know, God, please do these things. And then we get into the prayer and we keep praying. We pray for this guy. And then this is no lie. It's hard to tell in this picture. This is the only picture we have of this. But as soon as we say amen, remember there is thousands of people around us. And it's not like we're praying for an hour. This is just a few minutes. We say amen, and everyone's gone. There's not a car. There's not a person, and it is just dead calm, and a guy that we've been praying for says, thank you. He hadn't said one word in English. He was just moaning and groaning and talking to us in Hebrew, and I have no clue what the dude was saying up to this point, and he says, thank you, and we just all look around, we're going what in the world now here's the thing i would love to tell you this guy jumped up his leg was healed and he ran around and but he didn't but i'm telling you this because what that does is when you trust and when you're bold from the Holy Spirit, it makes it easier the next time and the next time. And these are things that God wants to move you to do. And if you don't move forward, guess what you're doing? You're stopped. And so it grew my trust because I really firmly, completely believe that God protected us and I'm not sure what happened with that guy but this is what happens we grew closer to each other I grew in my trust in my faith in God because I did not stop the second thing is fearless followers of Jesus don't stop because they are with Jesus. If somebody outside this church, if I asked them, hey, oh, fill in the blank your name, are they with Jesus? Are they walking with Jesus? What would they because this is the question the question is what does your life look like not just sitting in here on Sunday but what does your life look like who is at the center of your life you or Jesus so in Texas where I'm from like everything's very compartmentalized so I have no clue what y'all's life looks like but i'll tell you what it looks like there is there's a lot of christians that sunday is jesus monday through someday whatever that might be is work and then you have kids and hobbies and all these things and it's all compartmentalized but that person is at the center of it well what this looks, but that person is at the center of it. Well, what this looks like is Jesus is at the center of it. Galatians 5.25 says, since we are living by the Spirit, let us follow the Spirit's leading in every part of our lives, not some, every part. This is your life that Jesus Jesus has a hand in all of it. He is the filter. The very best example I can give of this is Pastor Chris Williams and his whole family. He talked about us being in group together many moons ago now. And one of the things he did when I barely even knew him, he shows up at the hospital for my kid that's getting ear tubes. Ear tubes aren't a big thing, but he shows up at five o'clock in the morning doing a jig back behind the cars in the middle of this parking garage at the hospital. I'm like, what in the world? But that's not normal. In many ways, right? But fast forward through all the years, and we're in this group, and he comes, and he's like, hey, I feel like I'm supposed to be a lead pastor, and I think I'm going to, I'm thinking we may go to Ohio. Not normal. I'm thinking we may go to Ohio. Not normal. Okay. I love y'all, but just let me be honest. People in Texas don't go, you know what sounds like a good place to move to? Ohio. I love it here. It's great. But I'm just telling you, they don't. People go, I'm going to move to Florida or, you know, just pick your thing. Like, it's just not what happens. Why do to move to florida or you know just pick your thing like this just not what happens why do you move to florida because this is what god wants you to do because he lived a life that he believed this is what god wanted for him and for his family and honestly for y'all. And he trusted in that. And his whole family moves way up here. Didn't have to. He could have stayed right where they were, doing what they were doing and everything would have been fine. But you know what he did? He trusted in God. He lived this thing out and he comes up here. The same with the Tates later on and the Meeks. Like this, this is what life looks like. This is living a life that does not stop. The third, fearless followers of Jesus don't stop because they see life change. Now you can argue all day anything that I say. When Chris is preaching or whatever pastor y'all have here happens to be preaching that day, you can argue all day. Well, I don't think that's actually accurate because, you know, whatever. You can argue the Bible. You can say, well, in this book it's spelled this way, this other book. You can argue all these things. But what you cannot argue, you cannot argue if somebody's this way one day and the next day they're different and it doesn't ever change. 2 Corinthians 5, 17 says, this means that anyone who belongs to Christ has The old life is gone, a new life has begun. We all know our own story and we all know people that we've seen this happen. When you know this about yourself and when you know this about others, you can't stop. You don't want to stop because this is what drives you. This is what moves you. And this is what you want. If you're one of those that were, you were this way and now you're this way, you want this for everybody. And then when you start pushing and moving and telling more and more people about Jesus and going and going and going, and you see God doing this, you just want more people to experience it. You want to see their life changed. And it multiplies. If you operate this way, you will not stop. There's a lady at our church back in Texas, and imagine the worst things, ladies. And I mean, I'm not joking when I say, imagine the worst things that could happen to you over a long period of time. This is her. Very bad. And she hated the church. She hated everything and everybody. said she hated everything and everybody I mean everything and everybody and she meets a guy that's a pastor at our church they're actually at a place exercising and he starts talking a little bit about Jesus and gradually over time she ends up committing her life to Jesus and she's saved. And just let me explain something. She is not even remotely close to the same person she was. She was one of the most depressed, full of anxiety, hate that you could ever know. And now she is one of the most joyful servant loving people you would ever meet you can't argue that God's the only one that can do that and if you go that way and you believe that and you see that if it's you and others it will not allow you to stop. So I've been running and I stopped, stupid move, I know, and I start walking back to my truck and it took me almost two hours to get back. It was terrible, but I get back to the truck and I'm like, oh my gosh. I sit down and I start it and the air's blowing on me and it's like the greatest thing ever and I go, I'm never stopping again. Ever. I don't care if my legs fall off. I'm going to keep dragging myself but I'm not stopping again. Fearless followers of Jesus don't stop and after I'd never stopped ever again, here's what happened. I ran a marathon. I ran the Austin marathon there's a picture of me and Jeremy he was here I remember what it was now three or four weeks ago this is Austin and this is after that training and then there's another picture of me and my little kids at the time that's noble and Lizzie he is now 15 and she is now 19 but here's the thing after that day of stopping I never stopped again I accomplished that and it pushed me to do another one I ran another one and I kept running I kept doing of course you look at me now I'm not running I don't really know what I want to achieve now but I just really don't I want to achieve a cheeseburger here in a second. But here's the thing. Like, I never stopped again, because here is the truth. If you stop, it does not make anything easier. The lie of the devil is going to make you feel like it is. It's a lie. It is not. It's going to make it harder. So let's slide down to verse 19 and I want to finish with this last little bit of scripture but Peter and John replied do you think God wants us to obey you rather than him and here verse 20 we cannot stop telling about everything we have seen and heard they could not stop they could not stop. They could not stop. We cannot stop. Fearless followers of Jesus cannot stop, will not stop, can't stop. What you have to do is you've got to go in right now, and you have got to identify the things that are trying to stop you. What is it? What hurt? What habit? What hang up? What is it that's trying to stop you? And you have got to push on that thing. You have got to be fearless in moving against it, removing it. Go to Region, meet with a pastor here. I don't know, I know this church and I know a lot of the pastors here and they love you and they want to do everything they can in their power along with God to come in and help you move. They don't want you to stop. So go to them you if you have stopped listen you've got to push you got to fight you got to grind because you know what stopped you and you got to push through it and you got to fight because guess what everything's coming at you in this world that wants to stop you because here's the thing this world wants to stop you. Because here's the thing, this world wants to silence you. You cannot stop. This world wants you to think you're less than. You can't stop. This world wants to instill fear in you, to you down to stop you guess what you cannot stop you've got to push and grind and know that the God that created everything is inside you and there is nothing and I mean nothing that can stop you so on your way out today here's what what we're going to do. There is these guys right here. You may have seen them when you walked in. I want you to grab one. And I want you to write your name on it. I want you to write a verse on it. Whatever you want to do, something of encouragement. And I want you to remember that you are not supposed to stop. Put it where you can see it. But something else that would be really fun, put it where you can see it. If something else would be really fun, put it where others can. Because here's what I want.

And that you're not going to stop because fearless followers of Jesus don't stop. Let me pray for y'all. Father, we love you. And God, in a world that's pushing so hard to try to slow us down and bring us to a halt, God, I pray for every person in this room, Lord, that they push, that they seek those things out that are trying to slow them down and stop them, God, that you make them apparent. And Lord, you come in and you help them remove those things where, God, they grow closer to you, they grow closer to each other, and they just multiply. That their lives look different. That these things in this world, God, that seriously, Lord, are telling us we're something else, that we're not supposed to lean on you, that we're only supposed to lean on ourself, God, that we reach out to you. Father, I pray that everyone in here, Lord, leans on each other, leans on you, and that, God, that this church, this community of believers here, Lord, just consumes this place. It changes this community. It changes this state, God, and it changes this world because of you. Father, be with us. We love you so much, Lord. It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen."}]}

I don't know about you, but for me, it's the video conference call. You know, when you're on the video, and then finally you can hear what they say. It's so frustrating. Or the time when you're on the call, and then all of a sudden, and you just wait to say, did they freeze, or is it a dramatic pause, right? But for some of you, it might be, you know what? Everything was going fine. My kids were making great grades. I would help with homework. And now I'm their math teacher and I'm teaching chemistry or language arts. And all of a sudden you're beginning to realize all this anxiety that you had in junior high because you couldn't figure out what the nucleus and the electron and all this kind of stuff is. Or maybe it's working from home and you think, man, this will be easy. I'll just kind of set up. I can stay in my pajamas, my slippers, and then all of a sudden, somebody's knocking on the door, or the cat knocks over your coffee. I mean, this is crazy, or maybe it's the fact that when you go to Walmart or any grocery store, now you're putting on gloves and a mask. Like, what's been the most challenging? For many of us, it's just not being able to hang out with our friends. I mean, I miss going to the movies, concerts. I miss sports. I mean, come on, where are sports? It's so challenging. And as you think about this social distancing, what I want to ask you about is probably, maybe I'm going to argue even more important. I want to ask you, when you think about these challenges, what about your relationships? In fact, I want to ask you a question. How has social distancing affected your relationships? I mean, I'm talking about the people you live with, that you work with, that you go to school with, people that you call your friends, your extended family, your neighbors, even people you go to church with. See, this social distancing thing, what it's done is it's created a whole new way we interact with one another. For some of us, we are interacting a whole lot more than we used to. I mean, you're seeing and talking to people a whole lot more because now you're together in the same house 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For others, it's a whole lot less. I mean, there's some people at work that you would call a friend that, let's be honest, you haven't talked to them in a month. For some of you, it's a whole lot more interaction. Now you're having a daily Zoom call with your boss, whereas before, maybe he would check in on you, or she would check in on you once a week, or maybe it's how you're interacting with your employees. Maybe it's a whole lot less. But whatever it is, how has it affected you? In fact, let me go one step farther. Let me ask you this question. Are your relationships, as you think about all these relationships in your life, do you feel like they're stronger? Or maybe they're strained. Or maybe they're just stagnant. They're not going anywhere. What would you say? In fact, here's what I want you to do. I want you to take that marker, that crayon, that pen, whatever, and your piece of paper, and I want you to take just a minute, and I want you to think about some of your relationships that if you were totally honest with me, totally honest with yourself, you would say, these are the names of the people that my relationships are strained. And if you need to make up a name because one of those people is sitting real close to you, that's okay for now, but you know who you're talking about, right? And just write down maybe three or four names. And I want you to take a few moments. These are those relationships where you would say, you know, over the last couple of days or weeks, like honestly, there's some tension in these relationships. So take just a few minutes and write this down. Write these names down. Who would those names be? Hey, my name is Matt. And I'm Chris. And we are pastors here at Fearless Church in Dayton, Ohio. And you just heard our other pastor, Chris, the balder one, give us a challenge to grab a pen, grab a pad of paper, and write down the names of people that we are feeling tense with right now. We're experiencing some relational tension. So what we want to do is as you participate in the activity, we're just going to participate with you. We want to model it. We want to talk through it a little bit. If you ignore us completely for the next couple minutes, no problem. If you're focused on your list, that's great. But we're just gonna walk it through with you. Yeah, so one of the names that I am gonna write down that comes to mind is my son, Eli. He's five years old and this time has been awesome with him. I've had a lot of great intentional time to have fun and get to play with him more than I usually do. At the same time, there's no escaping him right like we there's no activities that you can just go and do all your failsafe options of like if all else fails we could at least hop in the car and go to X Y or Z that X Y or Z is now not an option and so I just felt like man I've been losing my temper I've been more impatient just frustrated with him and how loud he can be and all that kind of stuff so I'm literally gonna write Eli down on my list. I can relate not so much with my kids but being locked in the same house and having no other outlets to pursue has caused all kinds of relational stress with me and my wife, my wife Jenna. And I've talked to her about this so I'm not speaking out of turn here. She knows that we're gonna talk about this. But the last three weeks of our marriage have honestly been probably the hardest three weeks of the last three years for us. Just more time together, we're communicating more, but it's leading to more miscommunications and we're just, you know, we're getting on each other's nerves, our routines are clashing a little bit, work from home and all that stuff, maybe you're experiencing the same thing. But I think that what this season has done has put a big highlighter to the fact that we thought we were really good at relationships. We thought, man, we're finally hitting our stride in marriage. We're figuring this thing out. Really, I think this season has revealed that we're probably just really good at our routine. And as soon as our routine is shaken up, we've got a lot of strife to deal with. And so we are, we're trying, we're having difficult conversations, long conversations, in some cases painful, emotional conversations, but at least now we are having them as a team. We're going to work through this thing together, and honestly, I think we'll thank God for the growth that He brings in this season. So I'm writing down my wife, Jenna. Yeah, I think another area for not just for me, but for all of us, that we're feeling tension is probably work relationships, and you probably think like all these guys are pastors So they don't have any tension and they're perfect in the way that they work together Which is not at all true like I we have been Instituting this thing or we run through the sermon the week before we give it And it's this awesome time where you get to encourage other people about like hey that was awesome or take that out That joke was not funny. That's very helpful for me but That has turned into now you send a video to the whole staff and they watch it and then they give you comments and all you get is a spreadsheet with everyone's thoughts and like I had to like I called Max I was like dude this like hurts like this was a great time before but now I feel like insecure about what I produced like I'm dejected like it's hard just talking to a camera, like we're literally doing now, we're getting more used to it, but it's very difficult to do these things. And so I just had to express some frustration and there's tension in those relationships because of the difference in all of our work relationships and just the way that we do our work. Yeah, when you see people face to face, you hear their heart. It's not just a cold comment in a spreadsheet. You hear their heart and assume the best about them because they're your friend. But if you don't connect with them face-to-face, it's pretty hard to do that. And honestly, I'm recognizing we used to bump into each other around the office all the time. And so you just have conversations about people's life and family and what they care about most. And it builds this relationship. But now, like now I have to go out of my way to do it. I recognized last week, I'm starting to have some frustration with some people on staff. And so I started making phone calls and just saying, hey, how's your wife? How are your kids right now? What's life look like for you? And all of a sudden I have these great conversations and we laugh and joke. And I remember that person's my friend. They're not just this annoyance that I have to deal with to get my work done. They're a great friend, and they're a person, and God loves them, and I love them. They care about me. It was just such a refreshing exercise for me. And so we want to encourage you. This isn't just something to write some names on a piece of paper and then crumble it up, throw it away, and do nothing with it. As you tune in for the remainder of this message, Pastor Chris is going to share with you a challenge. He's going to challenge you to put some feet to this, to take some action. And when you do, I wholeheartedly believe you're going to see God in the middle of it. So stay tuned with us. We're excited for what God is going to do in you and through you today. So as you look at those names on that list, you see some names of people that you interact with before all this COVID-19 a whole lot, some of them not as much. But I want to ask you this question. Why do you think those relationships are now strained? What has caused that tension in between you and them? And I think what it is, is we are definitely in a season of stress, right? There's a lot of unknown. And here's the reality. Stress has changed things and changed dynamics. And the reason is, is because of this. Stress reveals what distance conceals. Stress reveals what distance conceals. Here's what I mean by that. Like, we naturally move away from situations and people that stress us. I mean, that's totally normal. You're limiting your interaction with them. In fact, part of what we do as a culture, let's just be honest, is we busy ourselves at work or at school or in our social activities. And we keep so busy that even though we interact with each other, the truth is we're very distant from each other. Conversations are, hey, how you doing? I'm all right. They revolve around the sports or the latest movies or maybe a few pictures you may share of your grandkids. But ultimately, you're distant from people. But here's what's weird. During this season in our life, as stress has raised, maybe it's financially, maybe it's with your health, maybe it's in other areas of your life with homeschooling or working from home, whatever it might be, as stress increases, we begin to realize that some of this distancing that we have between ourselves and those that we love and care about, those that we work with, those that we interact with, it's beginning to reveal there's some damage that maybe this distance has been concealing in our lives for a while. So as you think about how you are navigating, and I am navigating this season of, quote, social distancing, navigating this season of, quote, social distancing, let's realize that this stress is beginning to reveal some things that are true about some of our relationships that aren't so good. So what would the Bible have to say about that? Well, the Bible has two kind of predominant messages. In fact, Jesus was asked one time, Jesus, what's the most important command or rule or law? Like, if you were to sum it all up, Jesus, what would you say? And he said this famous quote. Some of you may have even heard it or have it memorized. He says, the most important thing is to love the Lord God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength. And then he adds to it. He says, and the second is just as important, and that is to love your neighbor as yourself. In fact, one of Jesus's closest followers, his name was John. James and John, they were both the sons of Zebedee. James and John, they were both really close, kind of the inner circle, the closest three, if you will, if you include Peter, to Jesus. And John, even he's called the beloved, he knew a lot about Jesus and listened to a lot of what he said and learned from him. He really had a close relationship with Jesus. And he summed up in 1 John really what this second, if you will, message that is predominant in Scripture. Look at what he says in 1 John chapter 3 verse 11. This is the message you've heard from the very beginning. So he's saying, from the beginning of creation, like this is the message we hear over and over. From the beginning of Jesus' ministry, we hear this over and over and over. And he says, we should love one another. Love one another. And we think about all this stress in our relationship and all this revealing of what's happening and the damage in some of our distant relationships that we thought maybe were closer when they were or stronger than they were, and now they're strained. Ultimately, we're told, no, no, no, we've got to continue to press in. We've got to continue to love one another. And then he says something strange. The very next verse, check this out. He says, we must not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and killed his brother. He goes back to the very first murder that we have recorded in the history of the world, a big brother and a little brother. Do you know the story of Cain and Abel? If you don't, check this out. So this morning, I'm going to tell you a story, and it's from Genesis chapter 4. Now this story is about two brothers, and their mom and dad, they're actually Adam and Eve. Now Cain is the older of the two, and Cain is a farmer. Abel, who's the youngest, he's a shepherd. Now they grew up offering sacrifices to the Lord. And so in this particular story, Cain gives his offering, and it's of his harvest. story, Cain gives his offering and it's of his harvest. Now Abel, he gives his offering to the Lord and it is the firstborn of his flock. And so with these offerings, with these sacrifices, God knows the heart behind the sacrifices. And so in this story, God chose Abel's sacrifice because he knew Abel's heart. Now this kind of ticked off Cain. It made him very angry that God chose Abel's offering over his. And God actually saw this in Cain. He saw his anger and he actually warned Cain and said, you know, Cain, because of your pride and your selfishness, like this is dangerous. But Cain really didn't pride and your selfishness like this is dangerous but Cain really didn't listen and he just allowed that anger to kind of swell up in him and so he was out in the field with his brother Abel and this anger this jealousy everything just overtook his heart and he actually killed his brother Abel now like immediately Cain wanted to hide from that sin and he wanted to hide the fact that he had killed his brother. And then God comes looking for him and actually asks him. He says, Cain, where's your brother? And Cain responds by saying, you know, I don't know. Am I my brother's keeper? Like, he immediately lied to God, God who knows everything, and really and truly the saddened God's heart. And so he knew that he'd have to punish the sin cain was sent away from god he was no longer in god's presence what a crazy story i mean the anger and the jealousy and all that's coming up and and john asked us he said look don't be like cain and he asked this question and he says, well, why did he kill him? Why did Cain kill Abel? And he answers his own question. He says, the reason why is because Cain had been doing what was evil and his brother Abel had been doing what was righteous. And you say, wait a second. Like, as I think about the story, both these guys bring an offering or a sacrifice to God. Cain was a farmer, right? He brought this grain offering. Abel was a shepherd. He brought the firstborn of the lambs, of the sheep. And you say, well, why did God accept one and reject the other? Now, the Bible doesn't clearly tell us why, but as you look into the New Testament, the New Testament often reveals and illuminates what we find in the Old Testament. The author of Hebrews, he said it this way and pointed it to like this. He said, it was by faith that Abel brought a more acceptable offering to God than Cain did. Abel's offering gave evidence that he was a righteous man and God showed his approval of his gifts. Although Abel is long dead, he still speaks to us by his example of faith. The reality is, when it came time to present a sacrifice, an offering to God, Abel did it by faith. And he said, I'm going to hold nothing back from God. I'm going to bring my very best, the firstborn of my sheep. But Cain, he acted more out of obligation. Kind of like, what's the minimum requirement of this? And so when Cain realized, man, God has rejected me and God has rejected my half-hearted attempt at pursuing him, Cain became angry. He was angry at God. And listen to the conversation. This is what God says. He says, why are you so angry? The Lord asked Cain, why do you look so dejected? You will be accepted if you do what is right. You will be accepted. This is God's heartbeat to accept all of us, that we would all be part of his family. And he said, look, Cain, look, there is a way to be made right with me if you'll just do what's right. Now, I don't know about you, but in this story, I think I relate more to Cain than to Abel. Not that I've ever killed anybody or even thought about killing somebody, but the reality is like Cain, I kind of think, man, some of the stuff that I do for God or in pursuit of God is more out of kind of guilty obligation than faithful love and commitment. I mean, sometimes I'm asking myself, what's the minimum I can do to be made right with God? And God says, that's not how you approach me. I think so many times I want to come to God, you want to come to God, and we want to do it our way. Not God's way, like this is my way. We want to create our own truth. Like this is my truth. I take a little bit of the Bible, a little bit of my experience, a little bit of something I read online, and I create this belief system. I create this truth for me. We want to keep our own life. Like, I want to do things my way, my own wishes, my wants, desires, and I just want to add a little Jesus. And God says, no, no, no, no. Like, if you're going to be made right with me, you've got to approach me the right way. And there is a way, a way to be made right with God. And that's through Jesus. In fact, Jesus said one of the most controversial things. Listen to this. This even bothers people today. Listen to what Jesus said. He says, I am the way, not a way. I am the way, the truth, and the life. And then he says this sentence, and I know for some of you, this is hard for you to believe. Others of us said it's radically changed our life. He says, nobody's going to come to the Father. Nobody's going to come to God except through me. Jesus is that access point. He is the only way to be made right with God. And when God's interacting with Cain, he says, look, look, I want to accept you. I want to connect with you. I want you to connect with me, but you've got to come at this thing the right way. But if you refuse, if you reject me, if you reject this right way, or even today, if you and I reject Jesus and we say, we just can't, we just can't handle that there's only this one way and that no one acts as his God except through Jesus, he warns Cain. Look what he says. Check this out. If you refuse to do what is right, you choose to do it your own way, you choose to come at me half-heartedly, he says, then watch out. Sin is crouching at the door, eager to control you, but you must subdue it and be its master. Here's the reality. When we reject a righteousness that can be had with God, to be made right with God, only through faith in Christ, when we reject that, then we better be really careful. eventually sin is gonna overtake us and sin will ultimately lead to death and destruction in our lives and in all of our relationships. And that's exactly what happened to Cain. This relationship or lack of relationship that he had with God ultimately affect his relationship and was reflected and expressed in his relationship with other people, specifically with Abel. Same way in our lives. If we lack a relationship and a connection with God, eventually it's going to affect all those relationships around us. So what did Cain do? Well, he got really angry at God and got jealous of his brother. You heard this story. He ultimately killed his baby brother. And this is John's point. He's like, don't love like Cain. Like, don't be like Cain. He didn't love God. He didn't love people. He rejected God's way. And he said, look, you can't do this. Instead, we have to connect with people. We have to love one another based on and foundationally on our relationship with God. In fact, John continues, and watch what he says. He says, we love because he, talking about God first loved us. See, because we've experienced this relationship with God, because he's first loved us, he can love us and love to us and through us. Because he loved us, we have the ability to love him back. Because he loved us, we have the ability to love one another. And we've got to love in this way that says, you know what? My connection to God is going to affect my connection to you. In fact, John presses a little bit farther. Watch what he says. He says, if anyone says he loves God, so you're raising your hand, you're singing praises. I'm so devoted. He says, but yet you hate your brother. You're a liar. You're like Cain. You're lying. For he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. Do you see what he's doing here? He's saying, my relationship with other people actually reveals a lot about my relationship with God. Let me take it a step further. My love for other people actually reveals a lot about my love for God. And so if there's stress and strain in your life and in my life with other people around us, maybe we need to look one step farther and say, you know what? Maybe there's some stress and some strain in my relationship with God. Why? Well, because stress reveals what distance conceals. Like, is the stress I'm having with you, if the stress you're having with me, if our stress is there, does it reveal more about our relationship or maybe it reveals about this distance between me and God? I mean, I asked you at the very beginning, how are your relationships going? And I ask you again, like, how is this whole social distancing thing affecting your relationships, not just with one another, but your relationship with God. Like, as you experience conversations and things with those in your house, those that work through these Zoom calls at school, whatever it might be, these social interactions that are sometimes more stressful and more challenged in this season, is it maybe revealing more about your distance from God than you ever thought. See, when I lack patience with other people, man, I'm telling you, consistently, my relationship with other people is a great barometer of how things are going with me and God. Because the more I experience God's grace, God's love, God's forgiveness, God's patience, God's kindness, God's gentleness in my life, guess what happens? At the end of the day, I begin to produce more gentleness, kindness, love, mercy, grace in other people's lives. I begin to produce what God is embedding and doing inside of my heart because of my relationship with God. The question is, can we truly love God and not love people? You know what John says? No way. This is the commandment that we have heard from Jesus. Like whoever loves God must also love his brother. So in the midst of this, we have got to figure out how to love one another better. So that's why I think it's so important that you log in and you watch these next couple weeks. We're jumping into this series called Socially Distant, and it's just recognizing not what's happening just today, but what's been happening now for months, or let's just be honest, years. How you and I have been to take steps back away from one another and socially distance ourselves emotionally, relationally, and all of a sudden, we're not loving each other the way that God commands. In fact, the heartbeat behind this series is for you and I to figure out, open up God's Word and figure out, how do we build bridges, not barriers, with all the people God's put in our lives? How do we build those bridges? How do we, like God, build a bridge to connect with people? And you know who's the master bridge builder? It's God. God cares about building a bridge so much that he sent his only son. He took this initiative and said, I'm gonna send Jesus because I care about building bridges, not barriers. In fact, even today, the story of Cain and Abel, like, let me share with you just real quick, we'll do this fast, a couple things that I think about in building bridges between my life and others based on what I watched God do in that story. The very first thing is we've got to take notice. Like, we got to be paying attention, asking ourselves this question, what is that person on your list? Like, let your eyes drop down real quick stop looking at your phone or your laptop real quick look at that piece of paper look at one of those names you don't have to say it out loud but ask yourself what is their perspective no notice what god saw and what we see actually is true about cain it says this it says cain was very angry so ask yourself what, what is the thoughts and emotions this person's experiencing? Like sometimes you may look and you may say, they seem very angry, but the reality is they're very fearful. And you're looking and you're saying, I'm going to be taking notice. And he noticed the second part. He says, he looked, go back real quick. thank you, he looked dejected. So this is an opinion, right? And it's a perspective. We say, man, it looks like this person is scared. It looks like this person is hurt. And so we take notice of what's going on, and then after we take notice, we take initiative. Take initiative. That means we don't stay on the sidelines, and God is our best example. One of the Bible verses that you probably have heard, many of you have memorized, for God so loved the world that he gave his only son. What did God do? He gave. He took the initiative. While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. He took the initiative. God steps first. In the same way, if we're going to build bridges, we got yet sinners, Christ died for us. He took the initiative. God steps first in the same way. If we're gonna build bridges, we gotta notice what's going on in this relationship. What's the perspective of the other person, not just you, you know your perspective, you know your experience, what's their perspective? Take the initiative and when you take the initiative, ask questions. This is a lot more than making statements. This is a lot more than making statements. This is a lot more than you said this and this is why I feel this way. It's not about your agenda. It's saying, I wanna know what's going on. I'm gonna build that bridge. When Cain was so angry and so dejected because he felt rejected by God, listen to what God says to him. He says, why are you so angry? Why do you look so dejected? And I love to say it this way. A lot of times I'll ask questions of my friends and my family, and sometimes when there's tension, I'll say, tell me what you're thinking. Tell me what you're feeling. Tell me what happened. And what is an important question, but why is next level? Why pursues the heart? This is what you said. Let me ask you a question. Why did you say that? This is what you did. Man, can you share with me why you did that? Again, we're taking notice of what's going on in that relationship. We're taking the initiative to actually pursue that person, and then we're asking questions. And in the midst of that, I want you watch and this is something i notice we not only ask questions but we share the intent why are you asking those questions and and god was very clear with cain and it's funny because the same kind of conversation the same intent he had with cain he has with you and i today and he watched what he says he says you will be accepted if you do what's right. What does that tell you? God wants to accept you. God wants to restore and rebuild his relationship with you. Sin separates us from God. It distances us from God. It creates us a social distance, if you will, between us and our creator. But God says, I'll do whatever it takes. My desire is to restore and rebuild. In the same way, God says, because that's my desire for my people, I want my people to have that same desire, not only with himself, with God, but with other people. We ought to be known. God's people ought to be known as people that are all about restoring and rebuilding relationships, offering forgiveness and grace and patience like never before. And so it's all right for you to say as you're building that bridge, you know what? Like, man, I want to, I want to fix this. And in humility, it's okay to say to your friend, to that family member, where that tension is, man, I don't know how to do this, but man, I want to know why this happened, and I want to take whatever steps. Like, my intent is to restore and rebuild our relationship. You say, Chris, this is a lot of work. Like, this does not sound easy, and this is the last thing I would tell you. If we're going to be people that build bridges, not barriers, we have to remember the reason. Why would we do this? Why would we go to all this effort? Because all of you are smart enough to know as you walk through this process and over the next couple weeks as we learn even more practical ways to build bridges, like you know this isn't a hundred percent success rate thing. Why would we do this? Why would we do this? Because of what John said. We love because he first loved us. We build bridges, not barriers, because God first built a bridge, not a barrier to us. We reflect the heart of God by saying, you know what? These relationships in my life that are strained because of the stress of what I'm going on, it's only revealing what's been true, honestly, in that relationship for maybe years. But because of my relationship with Christ, I'm going to let that affect my relationship with you. And we begin to restore and rebuild, and we begin to build bridges, not barriers, because our God is a God who built bridges, not barriers, to us. What if that became true of us? What if this whole socially distanced season that we are all in right now, that is indeed at times stressful, what if it's all about God forming in us and helping us to become a lot more like him? A lot more like him in that we are restoring and rebuilding relationships. We are building bridges, not barriers. What if you were that one in the family to build bridges among some of the other family members that are having stress? What if we bridged racial divides? What if marriages were restored? What could God do in this season when we don't walk away from it, but we press in? We close the distance and say, God, I want to love people because you loved me. A lot of my buddies right now have told me, man, during this season, I'm just knocking out these home repair projects, right? And there's the honeydew list that many of you as husbands or wives, man, there's just a bunch of stuff you're knocking out because you're stuck at home, right? And you're fixing those blinds, you're fixing the squeaky door, you're doing all this kind of stuff. Well, here's my challenge to you. I want you to add to that list. I want you to add to that list. I want you to add, you see the name, and maybe there's three names on your list. Start, just take a couple minutes to pray about it and start with just one of those names. Circle that name and say, man, one of my goals in the next few days and weeks is to begin to have some relationship repairs. I'm going to do whatever it takes to take notice and to take stock and say, this must be what they're thinking or feeling. And then you take the initiative and you ask the questions, man, how did we get here? Why are you feeling that way? And you share the intent, man, I don't, I wanna restore this thing. And you remember the reason. Because my God loves me, I love you. And I'm gonna be in the business of restoring and rebuilding these relationships. What could God do? What could God do? What could God do in your house, in our church, in our community, in our country, if we became a people that built bridges, not barriers? Let's pray. God, I thank you so much for your desire to connect with us. God, I cannot fathom your love for us. I just, I can't. I can only know that you love us so much that you sent your son Jesus down here to die in our place so that we could restore and rebuild our relationship with you for now to all of eternity. And God, you ask us over and over again, man, love me, but also love each other. And God, I pray that we would be a people, that we would be a church, that we would be fearless followers of Jesus that build bridges, not barriers to people in and around our life. God, we love you. And I pray for those names on those lists all over the country right now, as we have circled one or two of those names, maybe we've written five names, whatever it may be, God, I pray that even this week, we would take the initiative and the steps to build bridges. Give us the ability and the wisdom and the love and the persistence to love because we have first been loved by you. God, we love you and we thank you so much for this time together. It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen."}]}

Finally, connect the themes of the sermon to the broader message of the movement series, which studies the mighty multiplication movement of God according to the book of Acts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Before we dive into the message this morning, I want to take just a few minutes to celebrate something that happened actually in this room about four weeks ago on September 25th. We had 65 people complete and graduate regeneration. So that's awesome. Yeah, you can give them a round of applause. To this point, we've had 110 people start and complete and go through regeneration. You might say, boy, that's awesome. What in the world is regeneration? I thought you might ask. Regeneration is actually a training environment that we have here at Fearless Church that helps people overcome addictions, past hurts, and destructive life patterns so they can experience recovery, healing, and freedom from any type of struggle. For me, I love Jesus, but the problem is I'm still in recovery. I'm not exactly like Jesus at this point. I'm a man that's recovering from pride, from lust, from control, from anger, from people pleasing. And these things have not helped me. They've become destructive life patterns in my life. So for me, what I have decided to do, and I've done already, has been through regeneration, not once, but twice. Because I believe this training environment, God has used so much in my life to transform the way I think, the way I feel, the way that I interact with God, interact with other people. In fact, those that are closest to me would say over the last three years, they've seen so much growth in the way that I process information and interact with them and the way that honestly, I just obey God. Again, I'm not perfect, but I've seen progress. And so many of you might remember, we actually started regeneration here at Fearless Church in November of last year, so it's almost been a complete year. And at that time, I shared with you our vision of all-in integration. Some of you might remember this, if not, I'll remind you. It's the goal of having every single all-in member of Fearless Church participate in this training environment sometime over the next three years. You say, what in the world is an all-in member at Fearless? It's somebody that many of you have already made this an all-in commitment to follow God's son, to connect to God's people and to contribute to God's mission here at Fearless Church. So if you call Fear and I'm gonna be a part of this training environment. And I'm gonna be a part of this training environment. And I'm gonna be a part of this training environment. And I'm gonna be a part of this training environment. And I'm gonna be a part of this training environment. And I'm gonna be a part of this training environment. And I'm gonna be a part of this training environment. And I'm gonna be a part of this training environment. And I'm gonna be a part of this training environment. it challenged me not just to know some information about God or know his word, but really apply it and live it out in a smaller circle. We do it gender only specific. So just guys sitting around in a circle processing and opening up, challenging me in my growth. The second thing is, is honestly preparation for leadership. I really do believe that regeneration will make you a better leader at work, a better leader in your home, a better leader at school, a better leader here at Fearless. And honestly, we are trying to recruit and train up more leaders as a part of regeneration because the third reason is to become a regeneration advocate. I honestly believe this training environment God will use in our community to reach thousands of people in the years to come. I really do believe that. I believe there'll be more people that enter and go through regeneration than attend our church. And that's perfectly all right. Because if you work the process and you experience what God can do through his word, through his spirit and his people, you will be completely transformed. So here's what I wanna ask you to do. I'm not asking you, if you're watching online, I'm not asking you to do is to prayerfully consider making a commitment for one night, one night, on November the 6th from 6.30, 8.30, right here at this campus. So if you're watching online, you can join us here. We're gonna have a two hour meeting just to describe to you and answer all your questions, give you details about what it might look like for you to be part of regeneration. It may not be the right time for you, and that's perfectly all right, but nothing is harmed. There's no commitment that you have to make to show up just one night. So you can go on our church website. You can register even as I'm talking. Show up and find out. We had people last year show up, and they were like, man, this is great. This is not the right time for me because of say, okay, when can I be part of this? Because even if you're a guest of ours and you say, this is my one and only time to be part of Fearless Church, you are welcome, invited, and encouraged to be part of regeneration. I mean, think about it. Imagine, imagine with me just for a second, what could God do in your life and through your life if what's holding you back no longer held you back? What could God do in your life and through your life if what keeps tripping you up no longer tripped you up and i'm telling you god wants more in your life and through your life than you can imagine so we hope to see you there on november 6th for our regeneration informational night now the last few weeks in fact we started in early september we've been in a series of messages called the movement And the goal behind this series has been to study the mighty multiplication movement of God according to the book of Acts. Acts was written by a man by the name of Luke. And many of you might recognize, you're like, I recognize that name because there's four gospels, there's four historical documents that tell us about the life and times of Jesus, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. So same Luke wrote the gospel. Luke also wrote this historical account of Acts. And in this account, he's recording for us a history of the Holy Spirit working in and through God's people, specifically the church. And this mighty multiplication movement of God back in the first century started with about 120 committed followers of Jesus Christ. And God did something amazing over the last 2,000 plus years. Here we are in the 21st century with over 2 billion people alive today that claim to follow Jesus Christ and are committed to follow Jesus Christ in over 150 different nations. It's been an amazing journey, and all this started, this mighty multiplication movement of God, with a promise that Jesus made. A promise he made to followers of his in the first century, 40 days after the resurrection. So he goes to the cross, dies, takes on the penalty of my sin, your sin on the cross, is dead, three days, raises up from the grave. And of course, those that saw him resurrected, they were all in, they were committed at this moment. He interacts with them about 40 days. And then right before he ascends and goes back up into heaven, he makes this promise. He says this, you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And then that's going to result in you being my witnesses. What does it mean to be a witness of Jesus Christ? It means you tell people about Jesus, about who he is, what he said, what he did, everywhere you go. And he said, this movement's gonna start in Jerusalem, but it's not gonna be contained to this simple location. Instead, the mighty movement of God is gonna expand to Judea and then eventually out to Samaria and ultimately all over the world to the ends of the earth. And then it happened. And we talked about this just a few weeks ago. Acts chapter two, the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came down upon God's people and then they proclaimed and began to tell people about Jesus, the hope of salvation for any and all people through the faith in Jesus Christ. And that day, that day, 3,000 people believed it, were baptized and joined the mighty multiplication movement of God. And so the promise of Jesus was right. The Holy Spirit's gonna come. And then Luke records for us in Acts chapter two through six, this movement expands all throughout Jerusalem. You'll read words like this. Many of the people, they heard their message, the message about Jesus, and they believed it. They were all in. So the number of believers now totaled about 5,000 men. That doesn't count the women and children. Some scholars say it could range anywhere from 10 to 20,000 people now in Jerusalem. You'll read things like this, that God's message continued to spread. The number of believers continued to increase. Where? In Jerusalem. In fact, many of the Jewish priests were converted as well. And this movement, just like Jesus promised, the Holy Spirit's going to come down and power this movement. It's going to go all throughout Jerusalem. And today, what we're going to look at is the next part of Jesus' promise. He said, then it's gonna move where? To Judea and Samaria. It's going to be expanded. Luke records this for us, this movement. He says it in these words. He said, all the believers except the apostles, they were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria. There it is. And what'd they do? They preached the good news about Jesus. Again, what Jesus said, his promise came to pass that the movement of God would start in Jerusalem and it would be expanded out. But this time it was a little bit different. Not only was it the Holy Spirit of God that empowered the mighty movement of God, but this movement was also propelled by persecution. Because Luke tells us they were scattered because that day a great wave of persecution hit Jerusalem. And this persecution expanded the movement of God into Judea and into Samaria. The mighty movement of God happened in one day when the Holy Spirit came down upon God's people at the day of Pentecost. And the mighty movement of God expanded in one day when persecution fell down upon God's people and propelled, propelled the movement forward, propelled the message to people in places that had never heard the good news of Jesus Christ. The mighty movement of God, it is empowered by the Spirit of God, but it is also, it is also propelled by persecution because persecution propels the movement. Now, Jesus, he predicted this. He said, look, when you think about following me, my movement involves persecution. He said, look, if they persecute me, expect that they're going to persecute you. Now, this doesn't seem like a good recruitment strategy. Like if you're a rabbi trying to get a bunch of followers, right? Hey, they're gonna mock me, make fun of me, beat me. I'm going to experience trauma and suffering and persecution. Come follow me and they'll do the same to you. That'll be great. Why would Jesus tell his followers that? Why would Jesus tell us that? He says, I want you to know this so that you don't abandon your faith when it happens. See, some Some of us believe, you've heard, you've read, whatever, that if you follow Jesus, everything's going to be great from this day forward. And then what happens is you go all in and then you still get cancer. You still lose your job. You still go through divorce. You still go through pain. Or maybe you're here today and you're watching online and you're just searching. You're like, man, I don't know about this Jesus stuff, but you know somebody that's committed to Jesus Christ. They're not perfect, but they're doing a pretty good job following him. And then all of a sudden, the same hurt and pain that you see all over the world, they experience as well. And you've been told, you've been duped, you somehow believe it's all gonna be, and Jesus is like, no, no, no, no, no, no. Look, if you follow me, your life might get harder. And I just don't want you to get scared and freaked out and abandon your faith when persecution comes on you. Because he wanted us to know as followers of Jesus, his movement includes persecution. Not only does it include persecution, but often it is persecution that propels the movement. Now, this was difficult for the first century followers of Jesus because the movement of God started like this. They would worship together at the temple. They'd meet in homes for the Lord's supper. And another way to say that is communion. And then they shared their meals with great joy and generosity. This sounds like a healthy church. I wanna be a part of this. He continues on and says, all the while they were enjoying the goodwill of the entire community, all the people, followers of Jesus and people who weren't followers of Jesus. People that didn't follow Jesus still had good will and intention towards them, and it was good. And many of them not only encouraged them, but even joined them, as Luke describes, they were added to their fellowship, those who joined the movement, those who were being saved. It was a great thing until one day everything changed, because one man refused to back down in the face of persecution. That man's name was Stephen. Stephen, we're told, was a man of great faith, full of the Holy Spirit. Luke tells us that God's grace was on him and the power of God was on him. How do we know the power of God was on this man? Because he would perform amazing miracles and signs among the people, just like Jesus did. Now this was unusual because it wasn't everybody that had this power, but as he was empowered by the spirit of God to do things that were miraculous, he experienced the same suffering that Jesus did. Jesus made the religious leaders mad. Stephen, honestly, empowered by the spirit of God, made the religious leaders mad and angry. They were jealous. They were jealous of what God was doing in his life and through his life. And so they would debate him and mock him. But none of them could stand against his wisdom, against the Spirit, which with Stephen spoke. It's when he spoke as if he was speaking the very words of God. So they came up with this plan. They persuaded some men to just make up some stories and lie about Stephen. So these people spread rumors. They said, man, we've heard he's blaspheming. He's mocking Moses. Moses was what? A trusted prophet among the people in Jerusalem, right? They're like, man, he's mocking Moses. He's mocking the law. He's even blaspheming and mocking God himself. So you can imagine what happened. This rose the people up and they were roused and the elders and teachers and religious law, finally, they just arrest him. They bring him before the high council. And one guy stands up and testifies and says, hey, look, this Stephen, he is mocking, he is blaspheming against the law, against our customs, against the temple, saying the temple's no longer needed. And in fact, he claims that Jesus says he's gonna destroy the temple, destroy our customs. And all of a sudden, they start staring at Stephen, not because of the accusations. They stare at Stephen because his face became bright as an angel's. Now, we see this. When you read throughout the Bible, you'll see this in the first part of your Bible, known as the Old Testament, and the second part, you're gonna see things like Moses, when Moses received the law, he came down from the mountain and his face was glowing, he had to wear a veil. You'll see Jesus, the Mount of Transfiguration, God was so much on him, he was glowing white. In this moment, Stephen, the Spirit of God was so on him that he was glowing bright, and they're like, this is not some normal dude. So they asked, they said, is what you're being accused of, is this true? Like, are you talking about the destruction of our temple? The destruction of our religious system? So Peter replies to him, excuse me, Stephen replies to him and says, brothers and fathers, listen to me. I think this is a wise way to start. He starts with language of familiarity, right? Family language, right? My contemporaries, fellow leaders of the faith, my elders, fellow fathers of the faith. And he starts with something they could all agree upon. He said, God, our glorious God appeared to our ancestor Abraham. And he takes them back and gives them a history, a little bit of information about the temple that they're so cherishing, about the system that they so want to still connect to God through. And Jesus has changed all that. He's changed all that. So he starts with Abraham. He says, remember God, God commanded Abraham to leave his land, leave his family, leave his people and go to the land that God would show him. Abraham obeyed. God fulfilled his promise. And he continues and says, then God brought him right here, right here, the land of Canaan, the land of Judah, to the land where you now live. And he said, now remember, and he reminds them of their history, and he says, remember, God didn't just immediately give him full possession of the land, he promised this land will be possessed by your descendants, but before it's possessed by your descendants, by future generations, and this was wild, because at the time, Abraham had no kids, he said, before that, they're gonna experience great suffering, great persecution. They're gonna be enslaved by the nation of Egypt. And he continues on and he says, but I, speaking about God, will punish that nation, the nation of Egypt, that enslaves them. God said, and in the end, they will come out and worship me here in this place. So again, Stephen, before the high council, he's reminding them of their history. And he says, and then God gave Abraham a sign, a sign of the covenant. And that sign was circumcision. Everybody say ouch. Right? And so Abraham, he did ultimately see God's fulfillment of the promise through a son by the name of Isaac. And on the eighth day, he was circumcised. Everybody say ouch. And that continued on to his son, Jacob, who was also circumcised and his 12 sons who were also circumcised as a sign of the covenant and the promise that God would one day give us this land. One of the sons of Jacob was a guy by the name of Joseph. Now, Joseph had these brothers that got jealous of him because honestly, Jacob favored him and did some cool things that he was like a favorite relationship. And so they did like some of us, they came up and then we got to figure out what to do. So they just said, let's sell him into slavery, right? And so they decided to sell him as a slave to Egypt. Now this was a hard time for Joseph and you can read all about this near the end of Genesis, but Joseph, God was with him the entire time. And ultimately, he ends up second in command over all of Egypt. Well, a great famine hits the land. And Joseph's 11 brothers had to bow their heads and take the trek to Egypt because they needed food. They begged Joseph. They go back with the food. They come back the second time. And the second time, Joseph's like, ta-da, it's me, remember? You sold me into slavery. They're scared to death. But ah, it's me, remember? You sold me into slavery. They're scared to death, but Joseph offers grace and says, no, you come live in Egypt, bring dad with you. It'll be awesome. It'll be wonderful. And then Stephen reminds the high council. He tells them, he says, and as time drew near, when God would fulfill his promise to Abraham, the number of people in Egypt greatly increased. You can read about this if you'd like later this afternoon in Exodus chapter one. The number increased and God had a new Pharaoh in position. So the old Pharaoh passed away, the new Pharaoh's there, and he's getting scared. It went from being hundreds of people to thousands of people. And he's like, man, we've got to do something. So he oppresses and enslaves the Hebrew people and persecutes them and forces them into hard labor, all these kind of things for over 400 years. And he eventually sees the growth is so large. He says, look, we've got to stop their multiplication. And the only way to stop that is we're going to tell all the Hebrew families, anybody who has a baby boy needs to kill him immediately. So they don't reproduce anymore. So the Hebrew people did that all, but one family the family of moses who said no no we're going to hide him we're going to keep him alive for three months and then some of you remember this from when you were little maybe in church they put moses in a little basket and they put it on the nile river and then pharaoh's daughter found him ultimately adopted him fast forward 40 years moses is walking around and as he's walking around, he sees this Egyptian persecuting, beating, and just oppressing a Hebrew man. He gets mad. He starts beating the guy up, ultimately killing him. The next day, he's out walking around again and he sees two Hebrew men fighting. And he walks up and he tries to break it up. And the one Hebrew guy just shoves him and says this. He says, look, are you gonna kill me too? Like you did the Egyptian yesterday? And Moses is like, this is awkward. So he takes off to the land of Midian, excuse me, and he lives there for 40 years. And one day, walking around again, all of a sudden he sees a burning bush. And from that bush, he hears the voice of God. An angel, a messenger communicates and says, Moses, I wanna use you to deliver, to rescue my people out of the land in the hand of slavery of Egypt. So Moses goes and obeys God. In fact, Stephen tells the high council, remember? Remember what Moses said? Moses told the people of Israel, God's going to raise up someone after me, a prophet. He's talking about Jesus there. This is a prophecy. This is a prediction like me from among your own people. Stephen continues and he says, look, Moses brought the law to the people. The people didn't respond positively to the law. In fact, they said, let's go back into Egypt. Moses ultimately builds a tabernacle and a tabernacle is like a big tent. And in this tabernacle would represent the power and the presence of God. Moses had it. Then he died. Joshua, who led the nation of Israel across into the promised land, had the tabernacle. Even David had the tabernacle. Eventually, David prays and asks God, God, can we build a permanent temple? And God didn't allow David to build the temple, but he allowed his son Solomon to build the temple. And then Stephen makes this point about the temple. He says, look, the most high God doesn't live in temples made by human hands. You're worried about me destroying the temple and talking about the destruction of the temple. God cannot be contained by our own human system and structures. It's a new day. It's no longer a day of rules and regulations. It's a day of relationship. Well, then he starts tearing it up and preaching to the people. He starts preaching to the high council. What Well, then he starts tearing it up and preaching to the people. He starts preaching to the high council. What he says, you stubborn people, what a great way to start out. You are heathen at heart, deaf to the truth. Most of you are, excuse me, must you forever resist the Holy Spirit? That's what your ancestors did and so do you. And then he makes this point. He said, name one prophet, a single prophet, that your ancestors, that they didn't persecute. They even killed the ones who predicted the coming of the righteous one, the one of Messiah, the Messiah who what? You betrayed and murdered. In fact, he says, you deliberately disobeyed God's law. God's law was designed to point you towards the Messiah. You disobeyed it. Even though you received this law from the hand of angels, it was angels that brought it to Moses and Moses brought it to you. It was angels that brought it to Moses and Moses brought it to you. And then watch how they respond. They're infuriated. How dare you? How dare you, Stephen, say that we are guilty of sin? How dare you imply that we break the law? We don't break the law. We enforce the law. And so Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, takes his eyes off of them and he gazes into heaven, and he saw the glory of God. What did he see? Jesus standing there in the place of honor at God's right hand. Some of you read that, and you're like, man, I thought Jesus sat at the right hand of God. But I think in this moment, we see Jesus standing up. Stephen is honoring God in the same way Jesus is honoring Stephen, one that's willing to sacrifice his life for the sake of the gospel, for the sake of salvation of humanity. Stephen cries out and he says, look, I see the heavens are open. The son of man, the son of man is a messianic title that we find in the prophet of Daniel. And Jesus often referred to himself. If you read through the gospels, the son of man does this, the son of man, he's talking about himself. He says, he's in the place of honor. Where is that? At God's right hand. Why is that position significant? Because God's right hand is a position of eternal authority and equality with God. So the high council hears this and they're like, are you claiming this Jesus is God? And the answer is yes. So watch how they respond. They put hands over their ears. They begin to shout and yell and they rush at him, drag him out of the city. They begin to stone him. And as they are stoning him, Stephen prays out, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. He falls to his knees and some of his last breaths, he's shouting out, Lord, don't charge them with this sin. With that, Last breath, he's shouting out, Lord, don't charge them with this sin. With that, Stephen died. Some of you probably recognize some of these phrases are very similar to what Jesus said on the cross. Father, into your hands, I commit my spirit. Father, forgive them for they know not what they do. Stephen in his last breath saying, Jesus, please, please receive me and please forgive them. And then he died. The first man in the history of the world, the first person in the history of the world, we have recorded as a martyr, as one who died for their faith and commitment to Jesus Christ. And then it happened. As soon as he died, a great wave of persecution began. All of a sudden it began to be hard to follow jesus and it took place so much in israel that it expanded out to the regions of judea and samaria and how did followers of jesus respond in that moment they kept preaching they kept sharing they kept proclaiming the good news about jesus christ my friends this is the very first fearless followers of Jesus who changed the world because they understood that persecution propels the movement. Now, I want to remind you of our vision as a church, what we believe God has called us to do. Our vision is to initiate a mighty multiplication movement of God. We would like to see God do it in the 21st century, what we read about and seeing him doing in the first century and other centuries as we study the history of the world. And you say, well, what in the world would a mighty movement of God look like? It looked like us becoming disciples who make disciples. In other words, people committed to know and follow Jesus and help others follow Jesus. And it looks like a commitment of us being a church that says, we're not just going to be a church that grows larger in one location. We're going to send people out from here in groups and teams to go start churches where both across the street here locally in greater Dayton, but also around the world to people in places that have never heard the good news about Jesus Christ. Now, now listen, if this is what God's called us to do, and this is what we see in the book of Acts, that persecution propels the movement, then we have to ask ourselves two key questions. The first one is, how will we respond to persecution? And if you're thinking this is the worst message you've ever heard, I'm with you. I hate that question. Because my response is to hope and pray that we'll never experience persecution. That's my plan. Yet, when I read the Bible, people like Paul says, look, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. Look, I took time this week to look up the original, it was originally written in Koine, Common Greek. Because I tried to find a way out of this one. The other way it can legitimately be translated, this will make you feel better, is all. So all who want to live a godly life. So you know what that means? Everybody. So here's the problem. Some of you, you're cool. You're like, dude, that's great. I don't care about living a godly life in Christ Jesus. And now you've just given me inspiration and motivation, even biblical reason not to follow Jesus. Awesome. But what about those of you that say, no, I'm in? I don't want to just know Jesus. I just don't want, I'm not just wanting to join a church, dude. I'm not just wanting to pray a prayer or get dunked in some water. I'm wanting to live this thing out. If you're in that category, then you and I should anticipate and expect persecution. I mean, remember what Jesus said? He said, look, why do you think you're better than me? Servant's not above his master. What in the world do you mean, Jesus? He said, look, if they persecute me, get ready, they're gonna persecute you. Here's the thing. I believe as we study scripture, it's better to note this. It's not a matter of if we will experience persecution, but when. So how will we respond? Like, what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? Because persecution is going to do what? It's gonna reveal and refine our faith. You'll know what you really believe about Jesus when it gets hard to follow Jesus. When we experience persecution, that's when it gets really real. Let me tell you something, Jesus was not shy about this. Jesus said, if you wanna follow me, it's gonna cost you. Let me say that again, to follow Jesus, it costs you. My question for you, my question for me is what's your price point? Like when it gets uncomfortable, is that when you're out? When it costs you a relationship, is that when you're out? When it costs you a relationship, is that when you're out? When it costs us our job, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What about when it costs us our freedom? What about when it costs us our lives? The most deadly century in the history, in the history of the world for followers of Jesus, you know what it was? The 20th century, the one we just lived through, over 40 million recorded cases of followers of Jesus dying for their faith. Already in this century, the 21st century, over 2 million recorded incidences of people dying because they're followers of Jesus Christ. Look, I know if persecution comes, we'll have less chairs in this room. My question for you is, will you be in one of them? What are you not willing to pay? What am I not willing to pay? Persecution propels the movement forward. I think our response to persecution is directly tied to our preparation for it. So that's the second question. The second question is this, how are we preparing for persecution? If you want to stay in the category of I'm hoping and praying, it just never happens. That's fine. But reality says sometime it will, and all over the world it is happening. Man, some of the mighty movement of gods that we see right now in our lifetime are among an extremely persecuted people. People in the Middle East that are extremely persecuted, imprisoned, beaten, even put to death for their faith. People in China, we see unprecedented growth because persecution propels the movement. So how do we prepare? Paul told his protege, young Timothy, he said this. He said, God's not given us a spirit of fear or timidity, but a power of love and self-discipline.'s break this down just for a second god has not given us a spirit of fear do you know when we face persecution if we respond in fear just know that's not from god because god has not given you and i a spirit of fear and timidity instead we have a spirit of power remember what jesus said you're going to receive what power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. Look how Luke describes it. He says, when Stephen was full of the Holy Spirit, in other words, the Holy Spirit was empowering him, that power prevented him from persecution. Nope, we don't see that, do we? The power of God did not work in and through his life to prevent it. No, what the power of God did, the Spirit of God empowered Stephen to focus in the face of persecution. Where did he focus? On Jesus. Because we have the Holy Spirit of God, if you're a follower of Jesus, you have the Spirit of God. You have the ability to focus on that which is most important and eternal in the face of temporal pain, suffering, and persecution. You have the ability, just like a soldier who takes a picture of his family and puts it in his helmet, puts his helmet on. He goes to the battlefield knowing this battlefield is not my home. He's given himself a focus and a vision of someone who's more important that he's fighting for. And that's what the Holy Spirit of God does for you and me. He gives us this spirit of power that empowers us to focus in the midst of persecution. It's not just a spirit of power, but it's one of love. God gives us the ability via the Holy Spirit to love him with an unfailing love. And let me just say this, as our love increases, so does our power to withstand in the midst of persecution. Love, love can overcome any form of persecution. My best example is my best friend, Jesus. Let me tell you something. Jesus died on the cross, hung on the cross, didn't come off the cross because of his power. It wasn't because of his power. He was mocked, beaten, spit upon, persecuted, even to the point of death. Not because he didn't have the power to stop it, but because he had the love to endure it. And that's how we endure persecution. Do we love God enough to die for him? And I already know, even those of you that don't follow Jesus, there's people in your life you love enough that you would say, yep, I'd be willing to die for them. I know them, I love them. I'm not saying I wanna die, but I'm saying I love that person enough, man. You talk about me, there's people in this room. My wife is one of them. I'm sorry, you're not. But man, I will step in front of a bullet for my wife because I love her. The same is true for Jesus Christ. So we have to ask a question. Okay, if we're gonna prepare for persecution, dude, how do we grow in this love? And the answer is self-discipline. See, we have a spirit inside of us that disciplines us to what? To have the power to both love and obey Jesus Christ. This word can be translated as sound mind, self-control, discipline. God gives you the ability to learn how to love him in such a way that you don't back down in the face of persecution. So let me ask you, how are you using that self-discipline? Here at Fearless Church, we talk about three things that God is going to use and will continue to use to grow you in your faith, to show you his power, to show you his love. And the three things are God's word, God's spirit, God's people. These three things God is going to use to show you and reveal his power and his love for you in your life. But these three things also require self-discipline. Let me ask you a question. What if persecution takes this away? Are you ready? Like what if all of a sudden, for whatever reason, and some of you techie people understand it and I don't, what if we can no longer get it on this device? What if our paper copies of the word of God are gone? Do you have God's word in your heart and mind? The psalmist said, I've hidden your word in my heart that I may not sin against God. I think because we have, and praise God, we live in a country where it's free. You can have 15 different translations in the Bible and all these cool apps and that's awesome. But what if persecution takes it away? What about this one? What about God's people? What about this one? What about God's people? What if we're not allowed to gather like this anymore? You say, don't worry, Chris, the government would never sanction any type of gathering. Our church started on a Sunday where they sanctioned our gathering. And I know it's because of COVID and I'm trying to controversy, but what about next time? Like what if it gets dangerous for us to gather? Are you, see most of us, myself included sometimes, we prioritize this based on convenience. If it's convenient, if it's easy, man, I'll meet with God's people. Man, if we're gonna be ready for persecution, we better have a spirit of self-discipline where this becomes a conviction. Where we're willing to do whatever it takes to meet with one another, to encourage one another, to motivate one another, to love in good works. We need one another. Even in the midst of persecution all over the nation, all over the world, excuse me, people are gathering in small groups committed to Jesus Christ to encourage, inspire one another underneath intense persecution. And the church is rapidly exploding. Why? Because persecution propels the movement. What about God's spirit? You say, man, they can't take away God's spirit from us. But I would just ask you this, honestly, like right now, would you say you understand and have experienced being led by the spirit? If not, that's okay. But right now, while we have freedom, why not learn how to hear the voice of God every day of your life that lines up with the word of God, daily led by the spirit and directed by the word. Like why not learn now and prepare? In order to prepare for persecution, you're gonna need power, love, and self-discipline. Here's the great news. If you're a follower of Jesus, you've been given a spirit of what? Power, love, and self-discipline. Chris, why do you, you're getting all sweaty and yelling, like, why do you think it's so important that we prepare for persecution? Listen, listen, y'all. Based on what we study in the book of Acts and throughout world history, you can Google this, it'll take you less than an hour, Christians experiencing persecution. And you're going to see a history of the world. Here's the reality. Here's the reality. Persecution propels the movement. And if we're a church that says, man, we want to be part of the mighty movement of God, it's going to be awesome. The Spirit of God is going to empower it. Yes. But I want you to know, persecution could propel it. Could take it to people in places that have never heard the good news of Jesus Christ. So are you ready? Am I ready? How will we respond? How will you and I respond when it stops being fun to follow Jesus? Why should we think in the first century that the Spirit of God empowered the movement, persecution propelled the movement? Why do we think it's going to be different anymore in the 21st century? What are you going to do? What am I going to do when it gets hard to follow Jesus? What about when it gets dangerous to follow Jesus? Will we abandon our faith or will we stand firm in our faith? We can't just ask how we're gonna respond. We gotta prepare. Listen, Jesus, when he was predicting what the future would look like, listen to what he says. He says, there's gonna be a time of great persecution. And now you can decide not to believe that, but he's predicting this is coming. We don't know the day or the hour, but great persecution is coming get ready what does that look like jesus says you're going to stand before authorities before kings and governments and you're going to stand trial you know why because you're my followers and in that moment that's not the moment to shrink back and try to protect ourselves instead he says let me reframe it for. In that moment when we endure persecution, this is your opportunity to not shrink back, but step up and boldly like Stephen did proclaim, there is salvation in no other name. Man, Jesus acknowledged, he acknowledged, look, everyone's gonna hate you because you're my followers. But in the face of persecution, when you stand firm, you will, one, two, three, say it with me. One, two, three. You'll win. You'll win your souls. What is a prophet of man if he gains the whole world yet forfeits or gives up his soul? They may kill your body, but they can't take away your salvation. Because that's the cure in Jesus Christ. So what if, what if we became a church that didn't fear persecution, but instead we prepared for it because we understood what the early church experienced, that persecution propels the movement. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, this is a tough message. God, we don't want persecution. Lord, we want your protection. We want you to allow us to live joyful, easy lives here on earth. But God, the more we study your word, the more we realize our life isn't just here on the earth. Our true home is with you in heaven. You are our eternal hope. You are our eternal joy. You are our eternal peace. And Lord, I pray you embolden us and empower us not to just hear a message and say, all right, well, hopefully I won't experience any of that kind of pain in the future. But instead, God, cause us to be a church that responds to your word and says, let's prepare. Let Cause us to be a church that responds to your word and says, let's prepare. Let's pursue knowing, reading, learning, living out the word of God. Let's be a church that pursues being led by the spirit, figuring out how do I let the spirit of God guide and direct and empower me. Let us be a church that prioritizes gathering with people, not just in this room, but outside of this room because we desperately need one another. Lord, help us have a spirit of self-discipline. And thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you that we've not been given a spirit of fear, but one of power, one of love, and one of self-discipline. God, prepare us. Prepare us for the days ahead that we will not abandon the faith, but stand firm, and in the end, win our souls. We love you, and we pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen."}]}

If you're watching online, we're glad to have you here. Before we dive into this morning's message, I want to take what I'm calling a pastoral moment. So if you're logging on for the first time, if you're a guest of ours, sometimes I like to take the first five or 10 minutes to just talk to those in the room that would say, I am all in here at Fearless Church. This is my faith family. And so if you're a guest, this is the time to tune out. This is the time to check email, text a friend, go grab a cup of coffee, whatever you want, or you can listen in on our family stuff. So for those of you that call Fearless home, I wanna ask you, as you drive around, have you seen these signs? No, or vote no rather to issue one. So you have probably seen these signs in your neighbor's yards, in your family, friends, maybe even you have probably seen these signs in your neighbor's yards, in your family, friends. Maybe even you have one of these signs. Or you've seen these signs as you have driven around and seen different churches have them in front. And you might be asking this question. Why does it seem like there's so many people that follow Jesus that would say, when it comes to this particular issue, we need to vote no. Well, there's multiple reasons, but probably the most common reason you'll hear people talk about is how issue one, this proposed constitutional amendment to the state of Ohio's constitution, will adjust and alter our laws and regulations in regard to abortion, even allowing for late-term abortions. And so then you have to ask this question, okay, so why is that a bad thing? Like, does followers of Jesus not respect and care about the right and freedom of women in and around our culture? And this is really helpful. If you're not following Jesus at this point or you're thinking about it, here's what happens. When someone makes a decision to follow Jesus, they've decided they believe certain things about him. Not only that he's the son of God, but that his death, his burial, his resurrection actually paid for their sin. So they would say, Jesus has rescued me from my sin, so he is my savior. But then, this is one we don't talk about a lot, I have decided that he will be my Lord. He will be my master. So in other words, when someone commits their life to Jesus, they're basically positioning themselves and saying, you know what, when it comes to matters in my life, God is now the first and the final authority. So regardless of what we're talking about, whether it's finances, relationships, whatever it might be, we're always looking and saying, who's the first voice? And as followers of Jesus, we say, well, it's God. So I gotta find out what God says. Then we listen and do research and find out other information. But then when it comes to the final say of what we decide, it's not our experience, it's not our ideas, not our opinions, but the final voice is God's voice. And so where do we find the first and final voice of God? It's in his word. And and final voice of God. It's in his word. And thankfully, when we address some of these challenging issues like abortion, God has a lot to say in his word what his perspective and his view is on the womb of any mother throughout the history of the world. Now, one of the beloved kings of Israel, his name was David. He was empowered by the spirit of God, and he wrote several psalms. One of his famous psalms is Psalm 139, and this is what he says. He was empowered by the Spirit of God, and he wrote several Psalms. One of his famous Psalms is Psalm 139, and this is what he says. He says, oh Lord, you've examined my heart. You know everything about me. And continues on in the Psalm, he said, I can't go anywhere whether you're not. Like, you know where I am. You know what's going on in my mind even more personal from the beginning. And he says this. He said, you made all the delicate and inner parts of my body. You knit me together. You hear that personal language? Now, where did this happen? He says, in my mother's womb. In the very beginning, Genesis, Genesis chapter 1, God says, let us make man in our own image. And who God's talking to is the Father, the Son, the Spirit, the triune God. to is the father the son the spirit the triune god let us make man in our own image and the image of god will create him and the image of god will create them male and female the only part of all creation created to bear the image of god is humanity and then the very next thing he says in chapter 1 verse 28 he says now go be fruitful and multiply in other words it is the calling of all humanity to reflect and replicate the image of God that the world would see God through how we relate to one another how we reflect that and how we replicate that and as followers of Jesus we recognize this high calling to reflect and replicate God's image both physically and spiritually and so it makes sense when a follower Jesus says I've got to protect the place, the place, the sacred space where God replicates his image. So that's why you find followers of Jesus all over the world fighting to ban and make abortion illegal and saying things like, let's vote no to issue one because they have decided the first and final authority in how I view what's going on in the mother's womb is not my own experience, it's not my culture, it's not my politics. Instead, it's God. Now, you might ask then, okay, now, so why would someone ever consider, hey, let's make sure abortion remains legal and legalize this? Well, I don't think it's a matter of people that are trying to cause pain and suffering in our world. In fact, I would argue those that argue and defend the legalization of abortion, they actually want to avoid or minimize pain and suffering. And they would argue, look, we need to recognize that pain and suffering often results in an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy. The pain and suffering that comes from a person making a decision, they would say, this is a bad decision. I ended up pregnant. Now, do I want that pain and suffering to continue? Or let's get more real. The pain and suffering of rape or incest to avoid or minimize the pain and suffering of rape or incest to avoid or minimize the pain of surfing they say man i after going through this like i just want it to stop in fact someone might argue and say look there's also pain and suffering that can result from high-risk pregnancies what about the pain and suffering the child or the mother will experience if they're not prepared emotionally mentally financially spiritually relationally whatever that be, to bring a child into this world. What about the birth defects the child may have? Imagine the pain and suffering that child will experience. Imagine the pain and suffering that could be experienced when there's real, legit medical issues that could ultimately result in the pain and suffering of the child's death or even the mother's. So I just want you to realize this issue isn't as easy as you might think because it's emotional. It's real. Now, here's the difference. We as followers of Jesus, when it comes to pain and suffering, we actually recognize, in fact, we build our understanding of God on the reality that God uses pain and suffering to forever change the world. And so when we think about how God uses pain and suffering, our first mind goes to the cross, right? God used an immense moment of pain and suffering, ultimately resulting in Jesus dying on the cross to bring new life to anybody who puts their faith in him. And so when it comes to what God's plan is and how he used pain and suffering, we recognize he's doing something in the secret. He's doing something that we can't see. Maybe we don't understand what that might be. And King David's saying, you're involved in those places in our world that we can't see. In the darkness of the womb, God is doing something, regardless of pain and suffering, that is bigger than us, something miraculous. And that's exactly what God does. I think about, for us, followers of Jesus, the womb reminds us to some weird extent of the tomb. Because in the tomb, we couldn't see what God was doing, but I promise you, he was doing something that forever changed the world. To this day, when I see a pregnant woman, I look and I say, I don't know what God's doing. I don't know his plan. I can't see the miracle he's forming in that womb, but I know he's up to something. God is doing something miraculous. So it is good for us as fearless followers of Jesus to recognize, man, sometimes pain and suffering does result in an unplanned, unwanted pregnancy. Sometimes pain and suffering actually comes from a crisis pregnancy. We need to recognize that, but then we need to remember the womb reminds us of the tomb. God has a plan, he's doing something. Now here's what's important. How do we talk about that with people in and around our culture? Because I think we have an opportunity not just to go to the polls and vote on this issue. You and I both know in the decades ahead, there'll be more issues. There'll be more things that we'll vote on. I think there's an opportunity to connect with people that we may not always agree with. But in order for that to happen, there's some things we need to do more and some things we need to honestly do less. We need to have more conversations and make less statements. We need to have conversations. The question you have to ask yourself and I have to ask myself is do I want to be heard or do I want to hear others? You say, what would that even look like? I think it looks like us asking more questions than making comments. Again, I'm not saying that we're not making any statement or any kind of comment, but we're asking questions. Oh, really? Tell me a little bit more how you came to that view. And I want you to know, you'll discover, regardless of where your view is on abortion or anything, you're going to discover as you ask people questions that oftentimes their answer is much more personal than positional. Behind every position, regardless of what it is, it isn't just because someone's ignorant or evil or whatever term you think if they disagree with you about any given issue. But there's a person behind that view, a story. And the reason we approach these potentially divisive issues in our culture in this manner is because we want more of the gospel, less of politics. One's important, but the other, don't forget, is eternal. And so we have to be mindful. I'm not saying abortion is a political issue. I recognize for those of us that follow Jesus, it's not political at all. It's a moral issue. But in our culture, what is it? It's political. So we have to use great wisdom and discernment how to respond and be careful not to build up any walls unnecessarily on someone's path to the gospel. You know who was great at this? Jesus. All the time. Those that were political leaders, those that were religious leaders, they would constantly want him to make a comment or say a statement, reveal a position, side with politics. In fact, they wanted Jesus to be a political leader. But Jesus responded. He used more questions, more stories, drew it to a conversation to make it personal because this was his priority, the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ. See, when it comes to politics, it's about avoiding pain and suffering. And the gospel actually is built on pain and suffering. Jesus Christ, when he died on the cross, that was the most pain and suffering our world has ever experienced. Now, there were other people that died by way of Roman execution on a cross. I'm not talking about just the physical pain and suffering. I'm talking about God's wrath, God's anger, God's judgment, God's anger, God's judgment, God's condemnation was poured out on Jesus, not because of what he did, but because of what I did, because of what you did, because of what we did, because of our sin. Why did Jesus endure that condemnation of God upon him on the cross? He endured that condemnation so we wouldn't have because there's no, no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus. So if you're in this room right now, if you're watching online and you've gone through the heartache of making a decision to have an abortion, I want you to know here at Fearless Church, we don't condemn you because that's not what God wants. God doesn't want condemnation for you. He wants hope and healing and salvation for you. Let me tell you something, when you turn to Jesus, you know what you get, not condemnation, but love, grace, mercy, forgiveness. These are the things, and church, this is the beloved message we have been entrusted with. So when it comes to these issues, like abortion or any other, in the days and decades ahead, as we discuss them with friends and family and neighbors. I'm telling you, let's do everything we can to not unnecessarily build a wall that prevents us from sharing the good news that there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. Let me pray for us and we'll jump into the message. Heavenly Father, Let me pray for us and we'll jump into the message. Heavenly Father, Lord, I guess on Tuesday, November 7th, our state has an opportunity to cast a vote, to have our voice heard. And Lord, my prayer is that that result, whatever it is, would align with your will and your way, perfectly. And God, give us the faith to trust you no matter the result. We know you're in charge and god my final prayer really is that you would give us an opportunity to share the gospel the good news of jesus christ with people that don't agree with our viewpoint lord don't let there be unnecessary walls instead of preventing people god may we be a path so people can know your goodness and know your gospel. Lord, use us in a mighty and a powerful way. Lord, we love you and we pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, last week, we looked at the story of the very first Christian martyr in the history of the world. His name was Stephen. And when Stephen was executed and murdered for his faith, a great wave of persecution began to spread throughout Jerusalem. And God actually used that persecution to propel the movement to new people in places like Judea and Samaria. The reason it happened that way is because when those people were scattered, they didn't get scared. Instead, they proclaimed the good news about Jesus. They would tell people about Jesus' life, about his teachings, about his death, about his resurrection, about salvation that is offered through him. They would tell this good news, and that's exactly what Jesus predicted. He had said in the beginning of Acts, he said, when the Holy Spirit comes, you're gonna tell people about me. It's gonna start in Jerusalem, but this movement is going to go way beyond one location. It's going to propel into Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. And so we're at our point in the study of Acts where we're seeing people respond. Many people are responding, and they're baptized, and they're aligning themselves, pledging their allegiance to Jesus Christ, both as their Savior and their Lord. And it's in the midst of this expansion of the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ that we go to Acts chapter 9. And Acts chapter 9 kicks off kind of the next iteration from Judea, Samaria. It's the beginning to the ends of the earth, and it starts with these two words, meanwhile, Saul. Meanwhile, Saul. Now, who is Saul? Saul was a prominent first century religious leader. And in fact, he would actually be one that persecuted and pressed against the church. When he wrote in his letter to followers of Jesus in Philippi, listen to what he says about himself. He says, I was circumcised when I was eight days old. I'm a pure-blooded citizen of Israel and a member of the tribe of Benjamin, a real Hebrew if there ever was one. In other words, I have a holy lineage. And he continues on. He says, I'm a member of the Pharisees. Just remember, the Pharisees, they demand the strictest obedience to the Jewish law. So in other words, I've been trained by says, and I was so zealous and passionate that I harshly persecuted the church. And indeed, that's exactly what Saul did. In fact, Luke records for us when the religious leaders rushed at Stephen and dragged him out of the city, and they began to actually stone him, that it was Saul that was standing there as they put coats near his feet. In fact, Luke goes farther and says he completely agreed with it. He oversaw it, and he agreed with the execution of Stephen. And that didn't stop him. It motivated him. So what he would do is he would do everything he could to destroy the church. He'd go from house to house. He'd drag it. It didn't matter if you're a man or a woman. He wanted to throw you into prison. His goal was to stop the mighty movement of God. But here's the crazy thing. We talked about this last week. The harder he persecuted, the more it propelled the movement. He wasn't able to stop the mighty multiplication movement of God. So as the movement is expanding now, we see that he is uttering threats with every breath. His desire, this is a guy whose desire was to say, if you're a follower of Jesus, what I want to do, I want to kill you. So he came up with this plan. He met with the high priest, because the high priest had authority to do some stuff. And he said, I need you to write me some letters addressed to the synagogues that are located in Damascus. And what I'm gonna do is I wanna have permission to arrest any followers of the way. Some of you might recognize that. The followers of the way, they weren't yet the way. Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life. So the way they lived was different. The person they followed was different. They were followers of the way. And he said, my goal, my goal is to stop them, bring them back in chains to Jerusalem and try them and imprison them. So his logical thinking was, the only way to stop the movement is stop the messengers. But he couldn't do that because everything in his life changed when he went on this mission. In fact, as he's going on this mission, a light from heaven suddenly shone around him. And then he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? I have no idea how your afternoon's gonna go. But if that happens, right, it freaks you out. So Saul responds. He says, who are you, Lord? Now, I want you to notice this lowercase l. So it's not an acknowledgement of submission to who the one is declaring, the voice. Instead, it's an acknowledgement of respect, almost a fearful respect like sir in our culture. Like, who are's an acknowledgement of respect, almost a fearful respect like, sir, in our culture. Like, who are you, sir? Like, what's going on? And then watch what happens. His voice replies and says, I'm Jesus. I'm the one you're pressing against. I'm the one you're persecuting. As the body of Christ, the church, Jesus cares so much about us. He says, you persecute my followers, you're persecuting me. And he goes on, he says, here's what I want you to do. I want you to get up and go into the city, and you'll be told what you must do there. Jesus' command is clear, but it's not complete. So many times, that's how Jesus talks to us. He says, I want you to go, and then you'll be told. And I don't know if you're like me, I don like him to answer all my questions, right? Like, if I'm going this direction, I trust you, Jesus, but it'd be nice if you could lay it out a little bit. Like, give me just, I mean, give me a five-year plan, all right? That'd be great, God. It'd be great. But oftentimes, you and I miss what God wants to teach us and do in and through our lives because we refuse to take that first little baby step. And in this moment he's saying, Saul, you wanna know the truth? You go there, go to Damascus, and then you'll be told. Well, the guys with him, they're standing there speechless. Why? Because they hear the voice, but they don't see anything. So Saul pops up and he stands up and he can't, he opens his eyes and he's blind. He can't see, so Luke tells us that his companions led him by the hand to Damascus. In that moment, Saul was dependent upon the sight and strength of others to lead him and help him take his next faith step. You don't see him as so much true of us. Like who do you have in your life that has experienced hearing the voice of God that helps you obey the command of God? We all need people that are there to help us in those moments, and this is a great example of Saul staying there. I can't see, I can't do anything, so the sight and strength of others helps me obey God. And Luke finally says, he remained there talking about Damascus, and he was blind for three days. He did not eat or drink. In such humility and response to this supernatural encounter he had with Jesus, he fasts, and again, he's in darkness for three days, just like Jesus was darkness in the tomb for three days. Luke goes on to tell us, now, God's doing other things, because somewhere else in time, there's this believer, this follower of Jesus in Damascus. His name was Ananias, and the Lord spoke to him in a vision. He said, Ananias. Yes, Lord, he replied. He said, here's what I want you to do I want you to go over to straight street to the house of Judas and when you get there ask for a man from Tarsus his name is Saul so seems pretty clear right and he says even right now as I'm talking to you that guy's praying to me and and I'm showing him a vision that you're coming like you're coming and and and you're gonna lay hands on him and then he'll see again and then An Ananias responds, exactly the way I would. But Lord, right, how many times have you been in a situation where you felt like God was telling you to do something and then you're stutter stepping? Like, but Lord, like, I try to tell God all the time and it hasn't worked very well in my life but I still try to do it. I try to tell God by, what you're telling me to do. God, this won't work. Like, it's not a good idea. And I've grown, I've made progress. I think 25% of the time I respond pretty obedient, and that's maybe bad to you, but I'm like, that's like 20% better than before, right? But I still stutter step. I get scared. We get scared. But Lord, and this is Ananias. He makes a great excuse. He says, look, I've heard some things, some terrible things. This guy, this is one who persecutes Christians. He said, look, he's been given authority to arrest people, so here's what's gonna happen, God. If I go, I'm gonna be arrested, and terrible things are gonna happen to me. Is that what you want? But the Lord said, again, it's funny, because God's always working in the background. He's always doing something. He sees things differently than you and I. And he says, I've got a great plan. You go, for Saul, this dude is my chosen instrument. To do what, God? To take my message to the Gentiles, and to the kings, as well as the people of Israel. This is the guy I'm gonna use to move beyond Judea and Samaria to the ends of the earth. So Ananias responds and he obeys and he goes and he prays over Saul and he's praying for him. He says, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road has sent me so that you might regain your sight, physical healing, and that you might be filled with the Holy Spirit, spiritual healing. God used Ananias to give Saul a new vision physically and a new vision spiritually. And Saul responds. He jumps up and God heals him instantly. And then he got baptized. Again, remember, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago. We said baptism is a public declaration of a person's allegiance to Jesus Christ. So this was Saul's way of saying, Jesus is the one who has forgiven me and saved me from my sin, and Jesus is now the one who has first and final authority in my life. He is my Lord. So just in case you're wondering, Luke tells us, don't worry. He regained his strength. He started eating some stuff, right? And he stayed a few days and then watch what he does next. Watch what Saul does immediately. He starts preaching about Jesus. Are you following this? In about a week's time, a guy goes from being a persecutor of those who follow Jesus to a preacher a persecutor of those who follow Jesus to a preacher telling people about Jesus. And the people are like, whoa, wait a second. This is the dude that was arresting friends, family, people in other cities. Like this is, now he's telling people about Jesus and Luke tells us his preaching just got more and more powerful, empowered by the spirit of God. And he, people couldn't even refute what he was saying because he was proclaiming, Jesus, this Jesus, he's indeed the Messiah, he's the chosen one, he's the anointed one, he's the one we've been looking for all these years, and in a weird twist of events, the Jews didn't like that in Damascus, and so they came up with a plot to kill him. The persecutor became the persecuted in one moment. So the followers of Jesus, they come to Saul and they tell him, look, this is what's happening. They wanna take you out. And so here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna help you escape. So they lower him down the outer wall of the city and get him to explain. He heads to Jerusalem. And as he came into Jerusalem, now remember, Jerusalem is where he what? He talked with that high priest, remember? He got the orders and the permission and the backing to go and represent the Jewish faith to be able to arrest these people who were following the way. And so he has this desire, I wanna meet with believers. I gotta tell them the story, it's gonna be awesome. And these believers are just like you and me. They're like, no way. They were afraid. They did not believe. He had truly become a believer like this is this is a trick and thankfully there was a guy named barnabas and some of you probably recognize that name if not you'll see it later as you read through acts but barnabas speaks up and he says no no i'm telling you this this is legit like the guy had this divine encounter with jesus christ on the road to damascus and i've watched him now for a long period of time preach and proclaim the good news that there is salvation in Christ alone. And so as he shares that news about him, all of a sudden, Saul is accepted by the other apostles, and he joins them in preaching and proclaiming the good news about Jesus, and maybe more importantly, then the church had peace. After an intense season of persecution, all of a sudden there's peace. Peace in Judea, Gal the church had peace. After an intense season of persecution, all of a sudden there's peace. Peace in Judea, Galilee, Samaria. And actually the church becomes stronger. The believers, they didn't live in fear of persecution or fear of the Lord. Reverence, acknowledgement of who God is in their life. And with the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, it also grew in numbers. The mighty multiplication movement of God gained momentum and this saw is also known as Paul he was filled with the Holy Spirit this Paul is the famous Apostle Paul whom the first century followers Jesus including the very closest to Jesus his His apostles said, there's something unique about Paul. When he preaches, when he writes, it's not as if it's his words, it's as if it's the very word of God. Listen what the apostle Peter said about Paul. He said, our beloved brother Paul wrote to you with the wisdom God gave him. And he continues on, he says, some of his commands are hard to understand. I'm so grateful for Bible verses like that. Like that's one to memorize. Because if you've ever read Paul's writings, there's times you're like, this is hard to understand. I'm like, yeah, Peter thought the same thing. So I'm like, awesome. So I'm in good company, right? And he goes on. He says, look, those who are ignorant and unstable, they twist what Paul says in his letters. In other words, in the first century, there were false teachers, just like there is in our century. People that are trying to twist the Bible to say what they wanted to say. But now this is the important, watch what he says. They do the same thing with what? Other parts of scripture. You catch that? He's equating what they recognize as holy scripture, as writings that they believe were inspired by God, communicated by God with Paul's letters. They had this view in the first century, even today. Today, do you know 13 of the 27 historical documents that make up what we call the New Testament were written by the Apostle Paul. We recognize that God was doing something unique in this Saul to Paul story. The apostle Paul, when he's writing to believers in Galatia, listen to what he says. He says, dear brothers, I want you to know, like, you need to understand the gospel I'm preaching is not based on mere human reasoning. In fact, I received this message from no human source, and no one taught me. Instead, I received it by direct revelation from Jesus. And then as Paul reflects on his past, watch what he says. He says, you know what I was like. Remember, I tried to stop the mighty movement of God. I was so zealous. My zeal for the traditions, all the rules, the regulations, it was greater than anybody else. But this is what Paul believed. This was his perspective. He said, you know what? Even before I was born, God, there it is again. God having a plan. Even before we were thought of, there's something God's doing. Even when we can't see it, hear it, experience it, God is working in the background. And Paul said, he had a plan, and he chose me, and he called me. Why? Is it because Paul was a really good dude? No, no, by his marvelous grace. What is grace? It is unmerited, unearned, undeserved favor. In other words, it's the reality that God knew everything about Saul. God knew about his plans and the execution of those plans. He knew about him standing there as people laid their coats down and murdered the very first follower of Jesus in the history of the world. Like he knows all that stuff and yet God says, I still choose you. You know the same is true of you and me. God knows everything about you. Remember King David said, you know my heart, you know everything about me. And some of you of you man that's when your heart rate beats because there's stuff people that know you best know nothing about you're like how could god know i thought that said that did that whatever it is but he still says i want you to be my child i want to choose you not by your own merit your own work but by my grace and that completely changed paul's perspective. He said, look, I really do believe that it pleased God. God was excited about the reality that he would reveal to me his son. Why? So that I would proclaim the good news about Jesus to the Gentiles. Saul, the persecutor, became Paul, the missionary, who eventually brought the good news of the gospel to the Gentiles of whom most of us, if not all of us, are in that category. You catch that? God used a persecutor, radically changed his life to turn him into a preacher to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ to people and places like us. All along, God had this plan, and God had this mission to do this, to share the good news of Jesus Christ. And most of what you know, if you've been following Jesus for a while, about how to follow Jesus, how to connect with God through a relationship with Christ, most of what you know and i know and believe is highly influenced by the apostle paul and the letters he wrote to the churches he helped start among the gentiles so what do we what do we learn from this all right we got it saw paul amazing story what do we learn we're here here at fearless church we have something we call the fearless code and the fearless code is made up of our unique values that make up the unique identity and culture of our church. We like to say it this way. It's not the only way to do church, but it is our way. These are things that are very important to us. And here at Fearless Church, part of our Fearless Code is we say this. Fearless followers of Jesus don't hide. In other words, we don't believe that we can become all that God wants us to be or do all that God wants us to do if we hide our failures, if we hide our weaknesses, if we hide our fears. We are committed, whether it's on this stage, in our community groups, on service team, we're going to be open, honest, and transparent about our weaknesses. Here at Fearless Church, we don't hide. And the reason this is so important is because we see this played out in the life of the Apostle Paul, the Saul to Paul story. In fact, Paul wrote to his young protege, Timothy, and listen to what he says. He said, this is a trustworthy statement, and everyone, so that includes you and me, we should accept it, and here it goes, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. Some of you need to grab hold of that, because some of you believe Jesus came to save good people. He didn't come to save good people. He came to save broken people, like me, and like you. Like, he came into this world with a great love to say you can't be good enough, that's why I'm going to the cross, to pay for your sin. He came to save sinners. And then watch, watch what Paul does. He says, and I'm the worst of them all. Paul believed that his story of failure could be twisted and turned around to a story of salvation for the people in and around his life. Listen to what he says. He says, look, by God, but God, he had mercy on me. You know what mercy is? It's withholding righteous judgment. So in other words, this is Paul's way of saying, you know what I deserve? For the way I've lived my life, I deserve death. I deserve hell. I deserve eternity separated from God. I deserve God's punishment. But God showed me what? Mercy. He withheld that judgment. Why? So that Christ Jesus could use me as a prime example. An example of what? Of his great patience with even the worst sinner. You catch that? God wanted to use the story of Saul to Paul to show people that God loves broken, hurting, desperate people. How was Saul saved and transformed to Paul? Not because of his good works, but because of God's good works. It's the character of God that results in the salvation of man. And Paul would say, this is so important because when I share that part of my story, others will realize they too can believe in him and receive eternal life. Paul knew his story, even though there was shame, dirtiness, and dingy. He stood there as other followers of Jesus were executed. He said, I know God can even use that part of my story. So I'm asking you, ask me, what part of your story is off limits? I ain't sharing that part, God, no way. This is my frustration. When we choose to hide, we prevent people from seeing the goodness of God. Because there's people here right now in this room watching online that say, God can't love me. Like, you don't know what I thought, you don't know what I said, you don't know what I, I'm too gone, like it can't be me because of my sin. And they not only know from the word of God but from the people of God when we both stand up and say, no, no, no, God can change your life. Not only can God change your life, God can still use you to do amazing and miraculous things. Like Paul, like Paul, fearless followers of Jesus don't hide. We refuse to hide our past failures and our present struggles so that people will know and understand that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom we are the worst. You have my full permission. When people talk about fearless and around the community, you just tell them, man, those people are the worst. Because we are. But we got the greatest God who loves us even in the midst of our brokenness and our depravity. God says, I still love you so much so that I'll make a way and his name is Jesus. Jesus came for people like me and you that are broken, that are sinners. So practically speaking, practically speaking, how do we don't hide? How do we live this thing out? The first thing I would say, we gotta confess our sin. And confessing just means agreeing. We gotta agree with God. God, you say this is sin, I agree with you. God, please forgive me. But we gotta go one step farther and confess our sins to each other. Ah! Don't you sometimes get frustrated with the Bible? Because I don't want you to know my sin. I want you to think I'm great. And Paul says, no, no, Chris, you live your life so they know I'm great. Because what happens is when I confess my sin to you and you confess your sin and we pray for another, watch this, may be healed. And that's the second thing, to be healed. So many of us hide from our past because we're not healed from our past. Should your past be a point of pain or purpose? And so many times it's not purpose because we haven't healed. This is why we offer these robust, hard, difficult, challenging training environments like regeneration. We offer stuff like that because we wanna help people overcome. We want you to experience that, and it's God's word, God's people, God's spirit. It's not regeneration that does it. It's God that does it. But we want you to experience recovery and healing and freedom because we know, we know, if you don't hide, God will use you to change the world. You confess your sin, you heal from your sin, all of a sudden you're in a position to share your transformation story. Share your Saul to Paul journey, just like he did. Look, this is who I was. This is Paul's testimony. My bet is that there's not many people in this room or even online that have this, yeah, I tried to kill Christians. That was kind of my hobby, right? And he said, but God, God revealed his son to me. God changed everything. And now, now I proclaim the good news about Jesus. See, fearless followers of Jesus don't hide. So I want to ask you, who is it? Who has God put in your life that desperately needs to hear that God can restore a marriage after an affair? They won't know it if you hide it who is it that God's put in your life that needs to hear someone that's struggling with prescription medicine can still can still be used by God who is it that God has put in your life that needs to hear that you don't have to be identified with your worst decision who is it in your life that needs to hear that even though you oversaw and approved the execution of the very first follower of Jesus who was martyred, you can still become a missionary to the nations? Let me tell you something. What God sees in you is way farther and bigger than what you see in you. And let me tell you something. We are all on a Saul to Paul journey. And God will not do things in your life and use you in the way that he wants you to unless we make a commitment and say, you know what, I ain't scared anymore. I ain't scared because I'm a fearless follower of Jesus, committed. Don't hide. Why? Because if we want to be used by God to change the world, we have to be committed to imitate people like the Apostle Paul and not hide our past, imitate people like the apostle Paul, and not hide our past, but allow God to use our past as a story to illustrate to the entire world that our God is so patient, so kind, so gracious, so mercy, so forgiving. Fearless followers of Jesus who change the world, don't hide. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for Paul's salvation story. Lord, what a radical story. A guy named Saul who's, let's just say, at evil and doing so much harm against you and your church. Jesus, you said, you're persecuting me, and yet you chose him. God, that should make us so bold that regardless of what we've done, where we've been, whatever, that you wanna radically change us and use us to change the world. So God, I pray for great faith over every one of us that hears these words from Luke that you preserve for us in the book of Acts, that today we would realize, no, no, no, God wants to use us, that we with our lives, our words and actions can proclaim the good news that Jesus Christ came to save sinners. Lord, let us be a church that refuses to pretend like we've got it all together, but instead in humility, in humility, we don't hide. We let you heal us and we let you use us for your glory, for your honor, and for the salvation of those in and around our lives. Lord, we love you and pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen."}]}

We are part of God's mighty multiplication movement, planning churches locally and globally. Why? Because there's still so many people and unreached people groups who have yet to hear the good news of Jesus. Every year, my family has prayed and given to the Be More offering because we know that there are billions of people across the globe who have never experienced God's goodness or even heard of the name of Jesus. Right now, our lives are crazy busy with kids and work schedules, but this is one way for us to be a part of something so much bigger than us, a way to share his name and love across the world. In 2022, Fearless Church planted for David. Because of your generosity, we've been able to focus all of our efforts on building a movement of missionaries who love their neighbors and make disciples with no financial uncertainties. We believe the seeds we've sown are going to change people's lives and bring those who are far from God near to Him. And it's all because of you. We can't thank you enough. Hey, Feelers Church, you are making a difference through your partnership with India Gospel League. You are making it possible for a church to be planted in every village of India through the Adopt-a-Region project. Over the next five years, you're going to make it possible to plant 360 churches in unreached villages. Thank you for what you're doing. So what can you do? I'd encourage you to pray and ask God what he would have you to do. If you're led to give financially, you can go to befearless.org and click on give. Last year, over $60,000 was raised, and every dollar went to multiplying movements. God might even lead you to be part of a future church plant going out from Fearless. Either way, I'm excited to see what God is going to do. Let's be more together. of November talking about what it looks like to be more together today is kind of the official kickoff of the be more kind of financial offering that we tend to take in the fall but as we kick that off I want to take just a moment today and maybe clarify something or maybe a couple things especially to our guests in the room I you know, I'm always sensitive to this idea. As new people walk in, and maybe you're here for the very first time, and you're like, oh, here we go. Day one, I'm in the church, and they show a video saying, hey, we would like your money. And some of you have had some bad experiences, not even just with churches, in other places in life, where people are saying, hey, we want more from you. We want something from you. Here's what I want to clarify. When we talk about giving here at Fearless Church, and when we take an offering of this size and this caliber, it is something that we are giving away, completely giving away. If you've been around Fearless Church, you know this. Like, we don't take offerings week in and week out. Some of you maybe sit here each week, and you actually wonder, where do we get our money, right? Is it like a unicorn somewhere making dollars for us? I don't know how this works. We don't take offerings week in and week out. But there are people in this church, and many of you, I'm looking at you. I don't know what you give, but you are sacrificial givers. You are amazingly generous people. And so you find one of our kind of small offering boxes scattered about. Some one of our kind of small offering boxes scattered about. Some of you have taken the time and attention. You go online and you found ways to give through our online portal and all of that. And I want to tell you this, you are a generous church, Fearless. You are a generous church. And I stand up here as a grateful person to be a part of it because God, because of what you're doing, has made it incredibly available for us to do ministry in and around our area We as a church are flexible day in and day out because of your continued generosity And you do that without us standing up here talking about it, and it's not that we don't think giving is valuable We know it's valuable in fact we know that when you give it's not that God needs something from you Have you ever thought about that God God actually doesn't need my money. He has a little bit more than I have But God does want something for us and And so as we give, there is something that God does in us. There is some things that he does to grow our faith and to build us. And whether that's releasing control or this or that, or just building trust, all these different aspects come when we grow in our faith from giving. But the point is, we stand up here not because we want something from you, we want something for you. And so you need to know, especially if you're brand new today, when we do talk about an offering like this, it's because we want to give it away. It's not staying here. It's not paying salaries. It's not continuing the ministry here. Again, that's what our generous regular giving is a part of. But a be more offering, that goes to multiply God's influence around the world. And that's why we're going to talk about it throughout the month. It goes to multiplying churches. We do want to be a church that starts churches. We've started a church locally. We want to continue to plant churches locally, but we want to start more churches globally. And we've got partners that we're doing that with again, here and around the world. We want to reach unreached people. There are people all over this planet right now that have no access to this name of Jesus. They have no idea when they wake up in the morning that there is a God that loves them so much that he would send his own son to connect them back to the Father. They don't know that, and we want to help them know that. One of our great partnerships is with the India Gospel League. You'll hear us talk a little bit more about that as well, and if you've been around here, you've probably heard about that. The India Gospel League is doing amazing work reaching indigenous leaders and pastors over in India. And we're planting churches and we're reaching unreached people over there. We sent a team earlier this year to head over there. That was part of even this Be More project to kind of scout out what God would have us do. We are have us do we are in a partnership right now with churches in our area to reach an entire region in india and i'd be happy to tell you all about that a lot more information on that it is a large region we had adopted some villages before now we've adopted a region and the goal believe it or not in five years is to plant 360 churches in that region and here's the crazy thing i think it's going to happen because of what God is doing over there in these first months of us even being connected to it they've already been 16 churches that have been planted and those churches themselves will multiply and continue to grow there's been almost 150 new believers for the first time that have understood who Jesus has and been baptized that's right yeah you can shout out for that God is on the move and we want to plant churches. We want to multiply. We want to go around the world. So I say all that again to say this, we're not up here saying, hey, we just want your money. No, but God can use your resource to make a difference in the world. And so we would encourage you to start praying now. Is there some way that you want to participate in be more? Again, we say it all the time. We're not going to twist your arms. We're just saying, hey, you go spend time with God. You pray, you ask. And if God responds to something, would you respond to him? And so, whatever that looks like for you, maybe begin praying now. So, you can go to befearless.org anytime. Again, we'll be talking about this for a couple months, but anytime you can go on there and get a little bit more information, or if you choose to give, you can go online and do that as well. All right, let's jump in today. Got a good crowd today. I feel like maybe that extra hour of sleep did everybody some good. I don't know, it did me a lot of good. There was certain days, today was one of those days, I was really glad we had the extra hour today. All right, fun question. Here's where we're starting today. Fun question. I think it's a great party question. This is a good question for you to sit around your dinner table, get some friends around and ask this question right here. What is the best decision you ever made? Ah, getting married. Dad, yes. Look at that. You just got some points right there. What's the best decision you ever made? I know this. All of you in the room have made some good decisions in life. It's fun to think about that, isn't it? To think back on some of those decisions that actually we're just, we're thrilled about. Decisions that maybe set us up in a relationship or set us up at work in a certain way or maybe even set us in the right direction financially, that there were some great decisions. And at the end of the day, we think to ourself, I'm sure glad I did that. It's the I'm sure glad I did that it's the I'm sure glad I did that choices that we make those are fun to think about you know it's not as fun to think about the I sure wish I hadn't decisions because my guess is we could answer this question to what is the worst decision you've ever made that kind of sours the party doesn't it we've all made some of those decisions some things that maybe we're not as happy about in fact maybe we're not at all proud of we've all made some of those decisions, some things that maybe we're not as happy about. In fact, maybe we're not at all proud of. We've made some decisions maybe that we are downright ashamed of, and they certainly didn't set us in the right direction. Maybe they set us back. You see, the reality is this, and I think we all know this to be true. We all know this to be true. The decisions that we make day in and day out, they significantly impact and influence the direction of our life. And we may sit here and think over time that, oh, there's stuff that just happens to us that we have nothing to do with. But the truth is the majority of our life is dictated by the decisions that you and I make every day. We know that decisions matter. Decisions do set the tone and the direction of the relationships in our life, day in and day out. Your decisions at work may move you forward or they may move you backward. Decisions do determine how we impact and lead our families and the people around us, how well people think of us. Decisions matter to set the tone in almost everything we do. And I think all of us, at the end of the day day we want to lay down at night and we want to say i've got more of those i'm sure glad i did decisions than these sure wish i hadn't decisions and that's just the day-to-day stuff but every now and then every now and then there's a decision that looms larger and some of you know what i'm talking about i call those like the pivotal moment decisions. They're just bigger. They're like a threshold moment. It's a decision that you know if you make, it will impact you for a long period of time. And some of you right now might be facing down a pivotal moment decision. I look out, I see some students, and you're maybe at the edge of whatever you're doing as a student, and you've got a pivotal moment coming. You need to decide where you're headed. What is next what is the step for you some of you are in a dating relationship right now and you realize you're at a pivotal moment you may need to decide where this is going am I getting married what is coming next you've got big financial decisions to make some of you are considering maybe buying a house for the first time maybe you're thinking about a job change maybe or maybe you have to consider a relocation, and that is a pivot moment decision, because a decision like that, it doesn't even just affect you, right? Now you're thinking, maybe do I uproot my kids? Do I move states away? Do I get closer to family, further from family? A lot of times, the pivotal decisions that we make are not even about us. They're about the people around us. Many of you are dealing with aging parents right now who aren't making pivotal decisions anymore but they're on your plate you're having to make that pivot moment decision for them but it's ultimately yours to make maybe it's retirement maybe it's other big things in your life listen some of these decisions they loom large and none of us none of us want to misstep when it comes to making a threshold decision. It may be the daily stuff or it can be these really big things. But for the sake of the people we care about, the sake of the people we lead, we all want to be better decision makers. And so if you've ever found yourself in kind of that moment of decision and you've thought to yourself, I don't know which way to go. But I sure wish I would step in the right direction, I'm glad you're here today, because that really is the subject that we're going to jump back into today. We're actually finishing up what we will call the movement. This is a series we've been in for a time now, and this is kind of the third installment. We've been doing this over the course of the last couple of months. We're studying this mighty multiplication movement of God. So God started a movement way back in the day when Jesus left the earth. He started this movement and we're studying it according to the book of Acts. Acts is one of these New Testament documents. It got written and it's in our Bible right now. It was written by a guy named Luke. Luke is one of the four gospel writers. We've got Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Luke is a physician, kind of a detail-oriented guy. And so he kind of curated this whole gospel to talk about who Jesus was and what he taught and all of this. But as Jesus was leaving the earth, he writes a second edition. It's called the book of Acts. And that's where we pick up the movement of God, the mission of God in this early church. And so we have this thing called the movement, and we're actually part of the movement today because it was the church that started way back then. And in the early stage of this series, we talked about how the church kind of got started and what happened and what was moving forward. And we quickly saw that this was an unstoppable movement. Even though in many cases it should have stopped, it was an unstoppable movement that God was using to change the world. And the last couple of weeks, we kind of stopped out. We looked at two key characters in the story of Acts. We looked at Stephen. He was the first martyr. He was a guy that was killed for his faith. But then last week, we talked about a second character. His name is Saul. And if you know much about the Bible, you may know that Saul ended up changing his name to Paul. We think of him as the Apostle. And Paul at one point was actually a murderer. He oversaw Stephen's murder. He was a persecutor of the early church. But Paul had this crazy encounter with Jesus. Changed his life forever. And it sort of sets the stage for where we are today. So today we're going to jump back into the movement. We're going to be in Acts 13. And so if you have a Bible, you can open to Acts 13. If not, we're going jump back into the movement. We're gonna be in Acts 13 And so if you have a Bible you can open to Acts 13 If not, we're gonna have all this up on the screen for you we're gonna pick up the story of the early church after Paul's great conversion and Here's what we see. We see that the early church is actually at a crossroads moment In other words, they're standing on the precipice of one of these pivotal moment decisions Up until now the majority of the movement has been centered around the Jewish people. We have all of these Jewish people who have now understood that the Messiah has come. Jesus is their Messiah. But it's not just for the Jews anymore. All of a sudden, the Gentiles are being invited to the party. The Gentiles were the people that at one point felt very distant from God. But now they're realizing that God is not that far away. And the early church movement is gathering strength and momentum. And so just like us, everyone is being invited into this relationship with Jesus. And in the midst of all of that, there's a pivot point. There's kind of a decision that that early church had to make. The biggest question they had to answer is how are we going to expand our reach? This is new to us. How are we going to take this message of Jesus, quite literally, to the ends of the earth? And so, we pick up this story in Acts 13. It's this moment of decision. Luke records this. He says, there was a church in Antioch. So, the church gathering in Antioch, and he lists a few of the people that were there. He says there's prophets, teachers, we've got Barnabas, Simeon, there's a guy named Manan, there's a guy named Lucius, you know, all those people. Then we got Saul. Saul's there. That's the one that we know as Paul, right? And while these people and that whole church are gathered, it says they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, and it says that the Holy Spirit said, set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I've called them. So after they fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and they sent them off. The two of them sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus. And as we would say, the rest of that is history, right? The rest of that is history. And my fear in reading these verses is this, that we will just read this as history. Luke was sort of a historian, and we see this, and it almost just feels like another historical footnote, but you realize what's happening here, right? This is actually a watershed moment. This really is a watershed moment that changed the course of history. This was a decision that that early church had to make. We get the vision of hindsight. They didn't. And one day they were either going to look back and say, boy, I'm sure glad we did, or I sure wish we hadn't. And the choice needed to be made. And here's what they decided to do. They decided to launch the first ever missionary journey of the church. That is the first ever missionary journey of this early church movement. They chose specific individuals. They appointed them to go out and represent the movement in different locations, in different cultures. It was a bold choice. It was a bold choice. It was a big move. And so we look at that, and they made this bold and faith-filled choice at a critical juncture. It turned out to be the right choice. We read through that. We see what God was doing with it. But it should beg us the question, right? What went into that decision-making process? How did they go about making that type of a bold, faith-filled decision at a critical moment in time? Well, the early church, certainly the people at Antioch, would say the Holy Spirit told us to do it. That's where they would start. They would say the Holy Spirit told us to do it. In fact, he says he spoke to them. Now, I don't know. Again, I don't know. I don't know if the Holy Spirit literally in a verbal way spoke to these people that were gathered in this place. I'm sort of guessing not. I sense what he's really saying here is we felt so connected with God that the Holy Spirit, it as if he was literally telling us what to do in this moment. We felt so confident of it. And then when we send these two guys out, we're sending them on the way, not just because we decided, but because we can say it was by the Holy Spirit. And we've talked about the Holy Spirit throughout this story of Acts already. The Holy Spirit was instrumental in starting the movement. story of Acts already. The Holy Spirit was instrumental in starting the movement. The Holy Spirit showed up in a very, very powerful way early on. The Holy Spirit did some amazing things, dramatic things, unexpected things, miracles were being done. But here's what we really see now as we shift kind of focus in the book of Acts, that the Holy Spirit, while the Holy Spirit does miracles and is super powerful, the Holy Spirit operated as their guide. The Holy Spirit was a guide. The Holy Spirit was a direction giver to the church. In fact, the Holy Spirit, the church would say, yeah, we believe that's the one who's offering us guidance in these moments of decision. And here's the thing. I think God still wants to do that today. And I don't know if you believe that. That God still wants to do that today. And I don't know if you believe that. That God still wants to offer us that moment-by-moment decision-making power today. God wants to give us direction. He wants to give you direction. He wants to give me direction. And He wants to do it through the Holy Spirit. Through the Holy Spirit. And if you and I want to be great decision-makers, or even just get better, start walking down the road of making better decisions, there's no better guide than the Holy Spirit. And so we need that day in and day out. We need more of those, I'm sure glad I did, decisions. And there was something in that early church movement that really allowed them to make room for the Holy Spirit. And that's what we're going to talk a little bit about. They made room for the Holy Spirit to inform their choices. There were some consistent practices. I'm going to talk a little bit about. They made room for the Holy Spirit to inform their choices. There were some consistent practices. I'm going to call them just habits. Habits that that early church movement have that we might do very well to emulate. They put themselves in a position to be good decision makers at some key times. And I think we can do the same if we follow their leads. I'm going to point to two habits of this early church movement. And we actually see them on display in Acts 13, but here's the first habit. Habit number one, I think, is this, that good decision makers, they get and stay connected with God. From the smallest everyday choices to the real big decisions in life, good decision makers will get and stay connected with God. And you might be thinking, well, no kidding, right? I mean, that seems pretty obvious. That feels like an obvious one, but here's the truth. When we're in the midst of making decisions, and I know this, especially the big decisions that take up a lot of bandwidth, what happens? It's not always our natural go-to to get focused on either getting connected or staying connected with God. Because here's why. it's not that we don't want god to get involved it's just that whatever the issue is at hand takes center stage and we get this cascading effect of decisions that come upon us and so maybe you've got a big decision to make about a relationship and guess what takes center stage that person in the relationship that's where you're spending your time and your energy maybe you've got got a big decision to make at work, and instead of staying and getting connected with God, you start thinking, alright, I'm working at work. I've got to talk about this coworker. And you start dealing with spreadsheets and all the stuff on your work schedule. If you've got a financial situation, you make decisions around finances, your heads get caught in the weeds of banking and checks and dollars and cents and all these kinds of things. We have families. We have people making decisions on behalf of. It takes up a lot of time and energy to hold those things in our mind. In other words, when decisions need to be made, it's natural we get very busy processing what's in front of us. And I do this. This is me. Like, this is me. This is my challenge. When I have to make some big decisions, here's what happens. I kind of set God off to the side I don't want to say I'm doing that but I kind of do that but they'll come and I can check in when I can't figure it out you ever do that or things don't quite work the way I want something was supposed to work it didn't work all right I'll check back in with God why didn't we make that work maybe if I feel like I've exhausted my resources. Here's one. See if you track with this. Sometimes I just make decisions, and then I check back in with God, kind of as an act or a kind gesture, because really what I want is his sample of approval, saying, well done. That was exactly what I was hoping you would do. Right? As things take center stage, and we check in with God at a later time, but he's not in the middle of the process And as it relates to really making good decisions We need to stay connected with the one who wants to be in the middle in the middle of it in the real time day By day decision making that we're doing it is not someone who is over here Wanting to consult when needed God wants to engage you and engage me in the daily grind of decision-making. And we build this habit. We build this habit right here. The early church movement did this, did this pretty well. They were onboarding a ton of new people, again, new faces, different people walking into the church, but they continued to gather together. We see that they gather together in large groups. We talked about this some weeks ago. They would gather in large groups regularly, much like this, but they would have teaching and they would get encouragement and they would challenge each other and stand kind of arm in arm. But beyond that, they would break into smaller homes and they would link arms that way. And they would be in community and in different pockets. Why? So that they could continue to learn and grow, but they would practice their faith. They would actually take the things they're learning and use them. Learn how to love each other, care for each other, and actually exercise faith in a real way. On top of that, people had their own personal kind of spiritual disciplines that they would engage in day in and day out to try to understand more and more of who god is you see they made it a habit of being together in this way we see it even here acts 13 when they're making this decision we just get again a picture of this church in antioch and what were they doing it says they were worshiping they were worshiping and luke lists kind of like maybe five individuals there but there's this church in antioch and they are regularly gathering to be together and more than that participating in other things that would point them toward God it says twice that they were fasting they prayed they set aside some intentional time to hear what it is that God was really wanting to say to them they intentionally spent some time with God and it helped them make better decisions and I don't think it was a religious formula I don't I don't think it was a religious formula. I don't. I don't think it was a religious formula. I don't think that early church got together to set the stage to say, here's a tradition. I don't think they were getting together in large groups and then meeting in homes and continually trying to reach out to God for the sake of tradition. They were doing it for the sake of change. They as individuals wanted to be changed. They as a church, as a movement, wanted to adapt their life. They wanted to conform more and more of who they were to more and more of who God was. And remember, they had known Jesus. Jesus was not a distant memory. Jesus was in and among some of them. They had firsthand account. They were there. They knew this person and this face, this name of Jesus. And they wanted to spend more time conforming more and more to who he is. See, they knew back then what we still know is true today. Who we spend our time with influences us. It really does. Who we spend our time with influences us. We will naturally become more like and maybe maybe make decisions more like, the people and the places we spend our time with and in. Parents know that. Parents know that. I see parents all the time, and what are they concerned about with their kids, right? Who are they hanging out with? Who are my kids' friends? And some of you have asked that as parents, because you know. What do you know about your kids' friends? They influence your kids because you spend time with them. And if they get the wrong friends, guess what? They might start making the wrong decisions. But that's why we want our kids to be great friends too. We want our kids to be the right friend because we want them to influence other people for real so that they might make better decisions. It's natural. Who we spend time with matters. We can form more and more to the people in our sphere. And again, it seems obvious, but back to the point, back to the point. When we get and stay connected with God, we're influenced. We're changed. We conform more and more of who we are to who God is. And guess what happens? When we do that, our decisions will more naturally fall in line with what God might want. There is actually a correlation between connecting with God and this ability of this early church to hear from the Holy Spirit. From the Holy Spirit. The Apostle Paul, again, the one that was sent out. He travels. Later, he writes a church in Rome. He writes a letter to the church in Rome. He says something very similar to them. He says something very similar to them. He says, don't conform to the pattern of the world. Be changed, be influenced, be transformed. Be transformed, he says, by the renewing of your mind. We all need to be transformed. We all need to be renewed. We can't continue to just walk down this road of the world that we live in. He's speaking about the whole of who we are. He says here, renew your mind. But as he says, renew your mind, it's not just about information. This is not about knowledge. Information is important. Knowledge is important. But us changing, us conforming to more and more who God is, it's not just about a set of facts. It's not just a set of truisms that we agree with. You know why? Because when we make decisions, we don't actually make decisions just based on a set of facts. If you think about that for a moment, if we made all of our decisions just based on what we actually know to be true, we'd make some really good decisions. But that's not true. All of our decisions are filtered through our emotions and in our passions and our ambitions, our backgrounds, our upbringings. So many things go into making you, you, and making me, me that influence our decisions. And so as Paul is saying, you need to be renewed. You need to be renewed and made fresh in your mind. It's not just about knowledge. It's about our hearts. It's about conforming the whole of who we are. All of those things, our ambitions, our passions, our desires, all of those things conforming more and more to God's passions, God's ambitions, God's desires, not just God's clean truth. It's conforming to a person, to the person of Jesus. And when we do that, when we start to get renewed more and more like that, here's what happens. He says, then you'll be able to test and approve what God's will is. That to me sounds like better decision-making. We start to be able to test and approve what God's will is. That to me sounds like better decision making. We start to be able to test and approve. In other words, we start to confirm more and more, yeah, that sounds right. I'm going to make a decision that's in line with God's will and his will is good and pleasing and perfect. See, when we get and stay connected with God, we're really trying to spend time with him in a way that we become more like him. Because when we do, this happens. We start to make decisions more naturally in line with the things that God would want for us and for the people around us. And those earliest followers of Jesus, they had to make some big decisions, some big moment decisions. And some of you are gonna have to make some big moment decisions. And some of you are going to have to make some big moment decisions. And so my encouragement, my encouragement is to get and stay connected with God. That is a habit. That is a habit that will help you in making good decisions. But here's a second habit, second habit of that early church. Looked like this. They didn't only get connected with God. They actually were getting and connecting with others. So they would get and stay connected with other people you know why because good decision makers don't make decisions alone good decision makers don't make decisions alone they actually seek out input and involvement from people around them when it comes to our decisions especially the big, we're wise if we don't go it alone. You've got to invite people into that process with you. Again, if we think back, just Acts 13, you see it right there. Again, Luke lists these four or five individuals. I don't know if he does that intentionally or not, but it feels a little bit like him saying, listen, that decision, the decision to send out these key players out into the world at this pivotal moment, you know what it wasn't made in? A vacuum. There was a plurality of leadership. In fact, the plurality of the church was gathered around. They were fasting. They were praying. There was a group of people making a decision together. They didn't go it alone. We see over and over in that early church movement, and we could trace it back, and we could look at the leadership structure even of how they build out elders and deacons and all of these different leadership things. And what you'll see is one common word, plurality. There is a plurality of leadership in that early church movement. No one individual making major decisions without at least the input and the influence of others. They didn't go it alone. See, some of our worst decision decision-making moments if we go back to that first question What's the worst decision you ever made I'd put some money on this some of our worst decisions come when we make decisions in isolation No one else knew we were making that decision And we make choices on our own and sometimes they're the not the right ones But in contrast some of our best decisions that we ever make come when we hear From other people. Solomon, Solomon, a man of great wisdom, says it real clearly. He says, hey, the way of fools seems right to them, but the wise listen to advice. He says, take good counsel. Take good counsel. I like that. Accept correction. That's the way to live wisely and well. At times in life, we all need good counsel. We need to seek it out or we need to have it. And I look back in my life, I'm so grateful. There are some times in my life I had some very good counsel, very good counsel. Probably one of the biggest decisions, biggest influential decisions I've ever made was to ask my wife to marry me. Her biggest decision was to say yes. But I remember making that decision. We had dated. It was about our third date, so I was just finishing college and not really sure where I was heading in life and this and that, and I met this girl, right? Oh, I was smitten. For young people, smitten means I was really into that. All right? Old person word. By the third date, we start talking about getting married because that just seemed like a great idea. But I didn't make the decision alone. I had some people in my life. In particular, I had a mentor. I had a mentor from college that was a good friend of mine. He was a little bit older than me. He was already married, and he had a family, and this and that. And he looked at me, and he asked some hard questions. And he said, let me ask you this. He said, is this what God wants or is this what you want? And I said to him, have you seen her? And I do, I think I share with him. I'm like, she's so pretty and she's so smart and she's so kind and she shares interests with me. And he looked right at me and he said, yeah. And if I walked out in the world today, I would find a lot of pretty people, a lot of smart people, a lot of kind people, and a lot of people that you would share interests with. Why this woman? Why now? It was a challenge. He was essentially saying, I would really like to talk more with you about this specific thing and say, is God in this? Are you seeing clearly to know what God's will is here? Now, I think ultimately I made a great decision I hope she would say the same but I didn't make the decision alone and I'm glad I didn't we all need the counsel we all need the advice we all need people around us we all need to get and stay connected with others we need some people who are willing to ask some hard questions we don't always know the right call to make we don't sometimes we don't. Sometimes we don't know if we're hearing God's voice or our voice. It sounds right, but sometimes we need a little confirmation. We need people that have more maturity than we do. Sometimes that's more spiritual maturity than we have. Sometimes it's more relational maturity than we have. If you're making decisions about work, sometimes you need people that have more vocational maturity than you have. Different experiences, different personalities, different backgrounds to weigh in and to press into you. We need people that will ask the hard questions. Sometimes ask the right questions. Sometimes what we really need is someone who is maybe not in our current situation to be able to step back and help to look at the bigger picture, to pull away from the emotion of it and say, hey, I'm not sure you're seeing this right, and help you process what's really right in front of you. We need those people that will ask the hard questions, remind us of God's faithfulness, and help us to step in the way that God would have us go. You want to be a good decision maker, man, build that habit of inviting other people into the process. Don't do it alone. Don't do it alone. Listen, I do think this. I do think we all want to be good decision makers. There's too much riding on it. There's too much in your life riding on it. There's too much in other people's lives, your family's lives, your kids' lives, your spouse's lives, your partner's lives, all these other people that you care about and you want to make the best decisions possible. And I don't know what you're on the precipice of deciding right now. You might just be in the daily grind right now of making your dozens to hundreds of decisions a day that affect your life, or maybe you are staring down kind of this pivot moment coming. Whatever it is, I believe God wants to nudge us in the right direction. I do. I don't think God is trying to trip us up. I don't think God is trying to trap us. I think God wants to, to press us and push us to walk in the right direction, to nudge, to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit. God really does want to speak to us through the Holy Spirit. And so as we wrap up today, I'm going today, I'm going to give you just two quick questions. They're going to just tie directly to what we just said. Two questions. You can process, think through a little bit that might help you step in that better direction. Here's the first question. Where or how do I need to connect with God? That's just an exploratory question we might all need to ask. And everybody in the room and in a room this size, you're in different places with God at this point. There may be some of you that maybe you're not connected with God at all at this point. And you're like, hear from the Holy Spirit. I'm not even sure God wants to hear from me, period. Like maybe you're new to this today. Maybe you're walking into here. Maybe your first step, honestly, for some of you your first step in this whole process is just doing more of this like like maybe you're not regularly in a large gathering the early church movement gathered regularly for teaching and encouragement and to be together and for some of you maybe your first step is saying hey i need to do this more often i need to be in this room or maybe not this room a room like this something like that more often for some of you maybe you just need to be more in a small group of people where you say i don't yet have those people i'm connected with i need to build more time more energy in those relationships i need to practice some of the faith i have i need to build into other people and sharpen sharpen my skills in certain ways in that area some of you maybe there's a particular practice a spiritual practice that maybe you've never tried or you tried at one point and kind of walked away from you know we can all stand here at times and say boy i you know i used to read or i used to study or i used to pray or or whatever it was maybe there's one of those practices that god is calling you back to maybe you've got a specific thing right now in your life and you know it's coming up and you've got a big decision to make and i've done this from time to time. Pick out something fresh, something new. Maybe it is fasting. Maybe it's just saying, I'm going to set aside some of the things that I care about in these moments to spend more time connecting with God. Find something, a spiritual practice to prompt you to take that step forward consistently with God. But at least ask yourself the question, where and how do I need to connect with God? Where do I need to connect with others? Who's your phone a friend right who's your phone a friend in a sense we say it all the time who are you gonna call don't call Ghostbusters call the Holy Ghost right no that's see that see no no that is the I sure wish I hadn't decision right there yeah no no good no no you got to have the people that are more mature than you find them and if it's someone older than you or someone outside of you spend more time with them initiate that conversation and don't just wonder who that person is like like actually make it happen sit down send a text let's grab coffee can I share with you something I'm thinking about don't make them have to intercept your life to find out what's happening talk with them share with them be a bit more vulnerable and say listen i need some help on this one i've got some big decisions to make and again that may be mom it may be dad it may be a friend it may be someone in this sphere of influence whatever it is find the right person that can help speak into your world listen listen the early church movement they've shown us a lot of things and they point us towards some habits that will help us move in this direction of being better decision makers they were intentional they were intentional about following the leadership of the holy spirit that early church movement they saw the holy spirit do miracles they saw the holy spirit come in power come an amazing demonstration but day by day that same Holy Spirit was the one they just leaned into that said speak to me speak to me in my life about the directions I'm going I'm telling you right now the Holy Spirit is alive and well the Holy Spirit hasn't gone anywhere the Holy Spirit lives in us. If we are followers of Jesus, lives in us, resides among us and around us. And God wants to speak to us through that Holy Spirit. And I wonder how many of you just need more confidence to know that you're hearing from the Spirit. Do you need more confidence to know it's the Holy Spirit speaking? Because when you hit that moment and you're like, yes, I believe the Holy Spirit has said that, doesn't it change your life for the better? Doesn't it lend more confidence to some of the things you're doing? It just does. And what would it look like if we had more confidence to really believe that the Holy Spirit was the one telling us what to do and where to go? In that relationship, if we just knew no the holy spirit is saying absolutely marry him don't marry him whatever it is if we knew the holy spirit was speaking it would change relationships it would change the way we parent it would change dating it would change all of it if we knew the holy spirit was speaking it would probably change the way we interact at work what we give our time and our attention to would certainly change the way we view our resources and how we spend our time and our money. God, what do you want me to do? It would be so great if we could all wake up tomorrow knowing that we're making more of those, I'm sure glad I did, decisions. And God wants to show us his will, his good, pleasing, and perfect will. So it's going to start with some renewal, conforming more of who we are, we the movement, conforming more of who we are, we the movement, conforming more of who we are to the more of who God is so that we can track with him, so that we can track with him and lean into that Holy Spirit. All right, let me pray for us. We'll head out. Father God, thank you for the time in the room today. God, I'm mindful even now as I stand here that what we do right here is not new, it's not novel. God, your people, your movement has been doing this for millennia. We're just so grateful that we are part of the movement that you started. It is an unstoppable movement. God, we do want to hear from you. We do want you to prompt us to walk in the right directions, to take the right steps, to make the right choices. But God, we don't want to do that in our own power. So help us lean into the Holy Spirit to hear more and more what it is you're saying to us. And we'll trust you to do that in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen."}]}

We are so, so glad that you're here. If you're tuning in online, maybe for the first time, welcome to you. And you'd say your reorientation is I have not been in church for quite a while, and it's time for me to step back in the doors. For some of you say, man, I haven't been to church. I don't even remember when, but I got invited and I decided to take the step and walk in today. And if you're here today, we want you to know that is not by accident. God has you here on purpose, and we're glad you're in our room today. And you've come at a great time. We have been talking about a fresh start all through August. It's part of our teaching series. But more than that, we are launching a bunch of events, different environments during what we call our fall semester here at Fearless Church. And we've tried to make it easy for you to figure out what your next faith step might be. We're not asking you to take huge jumps, just another step, another step toward what it is that God is asking you to be a part of. We want to help you get connected with other people, other families, other couples, other individuals in our church so that we can walk out this journey of faith together. And so as you walked in, you may have seen this. It's just a card that says Fresh Start on it. On the back, there's a bunch of different graphics and pictures. If you have never taken one of these throughout the month of August, as you leave today, make sure you grab one. You may have already had one, but if you didn't, grab one. The most important thing you'll find on the back is a website, freshstart.befearless.org. Tells you all of the different things that are happening in and around here throughout the start of this fall. Now, I recognize that some of these events that are on here, some have already launched, some of the registrations are closed, but you need to know there are still a lot of ways and a lot of pathways forward for you to get plugged in. And so we've got opportunities if you're looking to figure out, hey, where can I serve around here? That's coming up in Exploring Serving.

We're gonna finish up our teaching series, Fresh Start. So grab fresh coffee if you need it. Otherwise, open up a Bible app on your phone, grab a pen, grab a pencil, whatever you need to do to dial in to hear what God wants to say to you today about getting a fresh start in your world. Thank you. There we go. Okay. Hey, how are you guys doing? I want to start today. I want to recommend a good book, right? Everybody loves a good read. And this one, guys, is a real page turner. Okay, are you ready? This is an owner's manual for a Kawasaki jet ski from 1992. It's one of my faves. One of my faves. Just love to kick back and read this one. It's, I mean, it is a thrill ride, okay? It starts out a little slow, sure. I mean, lots of good books do that. I mean, it's got parts lists and health and safety warnings. But once it gets going, I mean, this thing, it's got everything you want in a good book. It's got twists and turns, like literally it's a jet ski joke. But I mean, it's got action, romance, heart, whatever you like, it's got it. It's one of my favorites. And you might think, I mean, that sounds kind of boring, but trust me, like it starts out slow, but when it gets to the middle, there's like this climax moment, right? I mean, I just get pins and needles thinking about it. I feel like I can't do it justice, though, so I'm going to read you just like an excerpt of one of my favorite books, so maybe you can join the fun, okay? So here we go. You ready? Yeah? Okay, gosh, come on, guys. All right, here we go. The passenger should hold on firmly either to the person in front of them or to the hand grip provided and sit astride the seat with their feet on the floor of the footwell. Never allow a passenger to ride in front of the operator. With the throttle lever released, push the start switch, the green button to start the engine. When the shift lever is in the forward position, the engine is running, the watercraft will move forward. This thing is about to move. Is this exciting or what? Oh my gosh, this is good one. Hey, this isn't compelling. Reading the jet ski manual is not compelling. Does anybody read a jet ski manual? Does anybody sit back in a comfy chair and read this thing for entertainment? No. If it's not compelling, it's because you're using it wrong. It was made for action. Nobody reads this for entertainment. This thing was made to be put into action. And I want to suggest to you today, this is the same thing. God's word wasn't made to just kick back and read for entertainment. Like this thing was made for action. If it doesn't feel compelling to you, it might be because you're not putting it into action. I remember where I was when I was 17 years old. I was on the mezzanine level of Elida High School, and I was running toward fourth period Spanish class to catch up with my friend Brandon. I knew Brandon was a Christian, and I wasn't. I didn't grow up in the church. I didn't know anything about Jesus. But recently, like in that season of my life, I started to get curious. I always sort of believed that there was a God. And I started to be interested in Jesus. And I read some of the scriptures for the first time. I read some of the teachings of Jesus. And I ran up to Brandon and I said, dude, this stuff is crazy. This is wild. If this stuff is true, this would change everything. I mean, nobody lives like this. Jesus tells us to love our enemies. Who does that? Jesus tells us to forgive 70 times seven, like over and over and over again. Somebody burns you, forgive them again. He says, if somebody hits you in the face, turn the other cheek. Nobody does this stuff. I said, Brandon, if this is real, we got to change the way we act. This would change everything. And he looked at me like I was nuts. He looked at me like I just grew a second head or something, like I was a freak. And I felt so rejected in that moment. I didn't understand. But later in life, I think in hindsight, I know why he looked at me like I was strange. I think Brandon, who grew up in the church, knew a dirty little secret that a lot of us might know if we've been going to church for a while, and it's this. You can come to a church building, and you can listen to the guy on stage talk about Jesus, and then you can just go to lunch. You don't have to do anything. You can even open up your Bible and read it some. You know, I read 10 minutes every day this week, and then you shut it, and you put it back on the shelf, and you don't do anything with they keep talking about community groups. I'll get in one of those. And so every Wednesday night, you sit in a circle in somebody's living room and you talk about what it would look like if you actually did something. You can do all those things and you don't have to do anything. I was so naive when I was 17. I thought you had to do it. I thought you opened up the word of God. And if it's really the word of God you had to do it I was so naive I missed those days in contrast I met another friend here at fearless about a month ago his name is Michael and he told me hey I've been an atheist for about 20 years but just recently I came to know Jesus and I started to read the scriptures for the first time I sort of knew the story of Jesus but I never read it and he's telling me about the stuff that he just read a couple days ago it was the story of Jesus, but I'd never read it. And he's telling me about the stuff that he just read a couple days ago. It was the story of Jesus washing the disciples' feet. Judas hadn't betrayed Jesus yet, but Jesus knew it was coming, and Jesus washed his feet anyways. And Michael's like in tears telling me about the stuff that he's reading. Like, this is just crazy. This is radical grace. Nobody forgives like this. Nobody is loving like this. He's blown away by it. And I realize he's got some fire, some life in him that I had when I was 17. And some of it sort of faded a little. Some of that flame that was burning is just like an ember that needs to be fanned back into a big flame again. And I wonder if you can relate. I wonder if some of you in the room would remember a time in your life where it's like, man, I was. I was pumped about what Jesus had done in my life. I was on fire. There was a time when I was more focused on God. There was a time where my faith was big. There was a time where I believed anything was possible. Like scriptures that say he's able, according to his great power at work within us to do immeasurably more than we could ever ask or imagine. I believe those things were true. And then life has a way of sort of beating it out of you, doesn't it? The routine and the busyness and grief and loss and failure and hardship, like have a way of sometimes squelching some of that fire that we had. If your spiritual life feels a little lifeless today, I want to suggest to you that the remedy is action. You were made for action. You weren't made to arrive safely at death someday. You were made for great purpose. You were made to put this thing into action. The Bible itself says it in the book of James. He says, don't just listen to God's word into action. The Bible itself says it. In the book of James, he says, don't just listen to God's word. You must do what it says. It's not enough to just know about it. It's not enough to just listen to it. You gotta do it. Otherwise, you're just fooling yourselves. You're not fooling God. You're probably not fooling the people around you. You're just sort of making a fool of yourself. You got to put it into action. The metaphor that always works for me, and I'm sorry, it's two water sports metaphors back to back. You're going to have to hang with me, but it's a kayak, okay? In a kayak, you have to paddle on both sides, right? Left, right, and that propels you forward. That's like know the word, do the word, know the word, do the word. And as you do that, there is this rhythm of knowing what god says and putting it into action our lives that propels us forward and it gives us an exhilarating life an adventurous life not a lifeless faith one that's exciting you know what people don't do nobody goes on a kayaking trip and says you know what i want to do i just want to sort of tread water for a while and sort of paddle in circles and get a sunburn they don't do. They want to fly down the river and feel the wind in their face. That's what's exciting. They don't want to know the word, know the word, know the word, know the word, know the word, know the word, know the word, know the word, and just go in a circle. That's not what faith is. Our faith is made to be put into action. And about two years ago, I felt like God gave me a little bit of a wake-up call. I felt like maybe I had been paddling in circles a little more than I would want to admit. Some of my flame had sort of burnt out, maybe not burnt out, it was still there, but it just wasn't what it used to be. I was in a spiritual rut. I needed a fresh start. And I feel like God, I turned 40 later on this year, so you could call it like right in the range for a midlife crisis. I'd prefer to call it midlife clarity. I feel like God gave me just like a motivational pep talk almost that said, Matt, you remember the 17-year-old kid? You remember the kid who thought all things were possible? The kid that felt like, man, I'm going to change the world. You know, we say that at Fearless sometimes, right? We want you to be fearless followers of Jesus that change the world. What a cool bumper sticker that would make, right? What a cool slogan. I'm just dumb enough to think it's true. I think I can change the world, and I think you can. I think because of God's power at work within us, we can make a difference that ripples through eternity. And in that moment, that midlife clarity moment, I realized, man, I don't, I got to wake up, man. I want my life to be about the main thing. The main thing. I don't wanna neglect the main thing anymore. And for the main thing, I wanna go to the last words of Jesus today, all right? Last words matter. With any luck, I'm gonna live a nice long life and I'm gonna speak millions and millions more words over the course of my life. But if I only had 10 minutes to live, you better believe I would say very targeted things to very specific people in my life. I would weight my words differently. And when Jesus only had moments left on this earth before he ascended into heaven and he had just this last message to give to his closest followers, this is what he says, okay? We're gonna find it in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and then Luke's Gospel that comes over into the next book that Luke wrote, which is Acts. All right, so we'll see it in Matthew, Mark, and in Acts. In Matthew 28, this is called the Great Commission. He says, go make disciples of all nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Teach them to obey everything that I've commanded you. And don't worry, I'm going to go with you. Go and tell people the good news everywhere, all nations. That's the great commission in Mark 16. It's not the great commission, but it's still a pretty good commission. That's a pastor joke. Mark 16, nobody laughed. Come on. You owe it. Chris tells corny jokes all the time. You got to laugh at one. Mark 16, he says, preach the gospel to all creation, to people everywhere, and everyone who believes and is baptized will be saved. He's saying the same thing. In Acts chapter one, he says, you'll be filled with power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you are gonna be my witnesses. Witnesses of what? To the good news of Jesus, to the things that Jesus did, to the fact that he's the only way to have eternal life, that he's the only way to have eternal life, that he's the only way to be made whole. He's the only way to have our sins forgiven. You will be witnesses of this great message of Jesus, and not just here in Jerusalem, but in Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth. You're going to go tell everyone everywhere the good news. You're going to tell everyone everywhere about Jesus. That's his message when he only has a few words left to speak. everywhere about Jesus. That's his message when he only has a few words left to speak. His heart is for everyone to know the truth about Jesus. It says as much in 1 Timothy 2. It says, God our Savior wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. That truth that he's talking about, this is the good news, the gospel. We say gospel and good news. They mean the same thing. And I want to be clear. The gospel is this, that God is holy and perfect. And you know as well as I do that we aren't. Every single day, I fall short of God's perfect standard. I'm not like Him. And I could try really hard. Like today, I'm going to follow all the rules. This will finally be the day. Like maybe this Tuesday, I'll finally live a perfect day. That's not how it works. No matter how much I try to follow the rules, I'm not perfect. And so maybe I say, okay, well, I know I've done some bad things, but I'll do way more good things than bad things. I'll make up for it. I'll pay back the debt that I owe God by doing a bunch of good things. But the do, I can't get on his level. I'm hopeless, dead in my sin. But praise God, when I was dead in my sin, he sent Jesus at just the right time to die for me while I was yet a sinner. He died for me because he loved me that much and he loves you that much. He died for me, took away the penalty of my sin, gave me his righteousness instead. And now I'm in fellowship with God. Now I can be with the Father. When God the Father looks at me, he doesn't see my failures. He doesn't see my past. He doesn't see shame and guilt. He sees the righteousness of his son, Jesus. And it changes my life now. And it changes my life forever. I get to be with him forever. This is the gospel. This is the gospel message. Paul says it again after, I guess it precedes 1 Timothy 2, but he says the same thing again in Romans 10. He says, everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. Everyone, everyone. So if you think that there's something in your past that disqualifies you, forget it. If you think that there are some labels that the church or society puts on people, like, well, this is good and this is bad, whatever, forget those labels for a second. I'm not saying that none of them are valuable, but forget those labels for a second. There's only one label that really matters. Those who call upon the name of the Lord. Every one of them will be saved. And then Paul drops a big but, and I said I wasn't going to say big but in this service, but I did. He drops, I tried not to. I said it in first. Paul drops a big butt in here, okay? And then he asked some rhetorical questions. But how? How can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in Jesus if they've never heard about him? And how are they going to hear about him unless someone tells them? And how will anyone go and tell them without being sent paul asked this question how how how he knows the answer god's answer is you how will it work you it'll work because you because i sent you this whole plan hinges on you you will go and tell them and when you tell them they'll hear and when they hear they'll believe and when they believe they can call on me and when they call on me they'll be saved absolutely every one of them the whole plan hinges on you and i wonder i wonder if there's some people in the crowd that are like oh man sharing the good news of jesus with somebody sounds terrifying i don't want to do this maybe i'm off the hook like breathe a sigh of relief it says that somebody would need to be sent right i'm not sent i'm not a pastor i haven't been called to be a missionary i'm certainly not an evangel i'm not billy graham i don't know anything about this stuff i'm not sent right are you sure are you positive you're not set because when jesus's words mattered most this is what he said go to people everywhere and tell them about jesus tell them the good news that's transformed your life and if you think that message was just for the disciples that heard it just for the church leaders like that's just not the example that we see in the new testament which by the way wasn't even written down yet the new testament wasn't a book to be read and then put on a shelf it was a story of good news that was meant to be shared with everybody, to run to the nearest person and say, this Jesus changed my life. We see people, Jew and Gentile, male and female, trained and untrained alike, going and sharing the good news. All they had, they didn't have a seminary degree they didn't have a great understanding of theology they didn't know it all you don't have to know it all all they had was the holy spirit alive in them and this passion that says jesus changes everything you got to know about it that's what an evangelist is they just run and tell good news. In fact, that word evangelist in the scriptures, there's a bunch of different Greek words. It's conjugated in a bunch of different ways. Today, I'm going to use one of them. It's euangelizo, okay? Euangelizo. And it sounds like a really spiritual word, right? It's even in Greek. Only a pastor would know that word. But it's not a super spiritual word. Euangelizo simply means to bring good news. It's somebody who brings good news. And it was a military term before it was a religious term. It'd be like an army goes out to battle, and if they win the battle, they send out an evangelist to run to the nearest town and say, hey, you know that battle that you were worried about? We want good news. We want. They sprint over there and tell the good news. That's why Paul goes on, the same verse we were just reading, the next one says, that's why the scriptures say, how beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news. He's conjuring up this image for people, for the original readers or original listeners to this text that they'd be like, oh, an evangelist, I get it. It's like the person who runs to go tell the good news. That's what I'm supposed to do. I'm supposed to run out there and tell the good news. They would get it. Fun fact, you know how we run marathons? I mean, I don't run, I would never, but you, some of you might. You know marathons. We get that word from a Greek legend of an evangelist. There was a battle won, and then an evangelist ran from the city of Marathon all the way, about 26 miles, to the city of Athens and shared the good news of a battle won and then promptly dropped dead of exhaustion. And that's why I will never run. Why would you run? That's terrible. If you've run a marathon, raise your hand. Okay, so like 99% of you are still normal. That's cool. That's great. What about a half marathon? Raise your hand for a half marathon. Y'all are still half crazy. Okay. That's honestly, I love you guys. Cause I'm a pastor and I have to, but, um, I don't understand your life choice. It's so weird. Why would you, I don't get it. More crowd participation, okay? Think for a second of your favorite restaurant. You got it in your head? Shout it out. What's your favorite restaurant? First one. Taco Bell? First service at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. That's a big jump from Taco Bell. Anyways. Yeah, college kids. That's right. That's all you can afford. I remember those days. If you have ever gone to a good restaurant, seen a good movie, read a good book, whatever, and then you went and told your friends, man, you got to go to this place. Their food is, their tacos are so good. You got to check out this movie. You got to read this book. If you've ever done that, you are an evangelist. Like you're bringing good news. This is what an evangelist does. They go and experience something that they think, this is good. This is worthwhile. I got to tell somebody. That's an evangelist. You are an evangelist. And you might say, okay, well, great. I mean, by that definition, sure, I'm an evangelist, but it's not like I know what I'm doing. I'm not qualified. I'm not trained. Yeah, you're in good company. That great commission that Jesus gave, this mission that he gave, think about the reject losers that he gave it to. Like, they were not the cream of the crop. He gave it to these untrained fishermen and people like that. They were kicked out of their rabbi school. They're not religious leaders. He gave it to a bunch of unqualified dudes and just said, go, share it. So if you feel unqualified, you're in great company. Furthermore, in 1 Peter 2, this is what the scriptures say about you who have accepted Jesus. Everybody in the room who said, you know what? I want to follow Jesus. It says you're a chosen people, as in you've been adopted by God. He's your father. Nothing can change that. You're a chosen people adopted in by him. You're a royal priesthood. If I said, man, this is a room filled with priests, you might bristle at that. Like, oh, that sounds weird. that's what the scriptures say about you in other words you don't get to just push it off on other people it's not the work just of pastors and priests who stand on a stage or work at a church to share to proclaim the good news of Jesus this is work for all of us this is a room filled with people who are called to this mission it says you're a holy nation God's's special possession. Why? So that you might declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness and into his wonderful light. You were made for this purpose. This is what he designed you for, to talk about the God that turned your life around, that raised you up to new life. You were dead in sin and then he raised you up. There's work for you to do. If wasn't respectfully i want to then why are you still here if there's not work for you to do why are you still here why when if the only point of living was just like well that i would accept jesus someday then how come when you accepted jesus he didn't just beam you up to a cloud somewhere you could have your harp and sprout some wings or i don't know what heaven's like that's not what heaven scratch like. That's not what heaven's like. Scratch that. That's probably not what heaven's like. But why are you still here? Why wouldn't he just beam you up? You're here because there's still work to do. You have purpose. You were made for purpose. And in fact, this is one of my favorite verses in all the scripture from Ephesians 2.10. Sorry, I lost it in my head. It's my favorite. Ephesians 2 10 you were made specifically for purpose not just generically for this purpose you were made specifically God's masterpiece he made you just the way he wanted you to be you are uniquely you he made you brand new in Christ Jesus so that you could do the good things that he planned for you long ago what are the good things you want to lead. He made you to share the good news. He made you to declare the praises of the one who called you out of darkness and into his wonderful light. You were made for this. There's a sort of a modern parable about a guy who's walking down a shoreline. He's walking down the beach, and a big storm had just blown in, and it just washed up. I mean, it just blew up like 10,000 starfish down the shore. Starfish everywhere. And he's walking down the beach, and he sees a kid pick up a starfish and fling it into the ocean. Takes another one, takes another one, flings it into the ocean. And he walks up, and he says, young man, what is it that you're doing? And the kid explains, the sun's coming out. Like it's gonna burn up these starfish. They're all gonna die. I'm trying to save the starfish. Somebody's gotta save the starfish. I'm trying to save the starfish. And the guy says, oh man, I don't wanna be the bearer of bad news, son, but around you. I mean, the beach stretches for miles. There's tens of thousands of these things. You can't save the starfish. What difference can you possibly make? And the boy picks up another starfish and he flings it in and he says, well, I mean, it made a difference to that one. Like, it made a difference to that one. I wonder who the one is in your life. It might be a bunch. Everybody has one. I wonder who the one is in your life who needs to know that there's hope. The person who's overwhelmed, who feels like, man, life has passed me by. The one who feels like I could never be loved, who feels like I've messed up too much to ever be redeemed. Who is the person in your life that needs to know that there's hope? And again, lovingly, I guess it's a challenge, but lovingly as a pastor, I want to ask you, do they know that you have hope for them? Are you waiting for somebody else to go to them as if you're not plan A? You are God's plan A. There's no backup plan coming. plan a you are planet you are god's plan a there's no backup plan coming jesus himself who the scriptures call the light of the world says you are the light of the world i want to say no no jesus that's you that's not me you're the light of the world he says no i mean i am but you're the light of the world you share a title with jesus, and you can't light up the whole world. I know that. I know the world feels hopelessly broken sometimes. It feels like the problems are too big to ever make a dent in them. It feels like we could never actually be fearless followers of Jesus that changed the world. I know it feels that way sometimes. You might not be able to light up the whole world, but you can light up your world. You can make a tremendous difference, an eternal difference, something that changes the course of history for the life of the person who is in your circle. They're not in my circle. I can't do it for you. You are a uniquely created masterpiece of God. You have circles of influence. You have a certain personality type. You have certain life experiences and skills. You have things that are just different than me. You have a unique in to be able to share hope with people. I can't do it for you. I want to ask, if you're not sent to them, then who is? If not you, then who? Who will go to them if it's not you? You are sent. you are sent. You are sent. You're the ones who are supposed to go. We all are. And the world needs it. The more you interact with people, like the more you know, people are hurting. They don't need us to slam the Bible hammer down on their heads. They don't need judgment, and they don't need us to sort of sanctimoniously tell them why we're right and they're wrong. We think of that as preaching. Preaching has got such a negative connotation now. But biblical preaching isn't like that. Biblical preaching is, I've got good news. I have something that's genuinely good. Are you overwhelmed? You feel like you'll never be good enough? You're struggling with grief. You don't know how to move forward. You feel like you'll never really be fully known and fully loved. You just feel rejected. But like I have good news because I was filled with guilt and now God's replaced it with joy. I used to be scared and anxious, but now he's given me peace that goes beyond my circumstances. He's given me hope that can't be shaken. I was addicted, now I'm free. My marriage was broken, now it's restored. I was abandoned, now I'm adopted. I was lost, now I'm loved. I was in darkness and now I'm raised to new life in Christ. He called me out of darkness and into his wonderful light. I have good news. This is your purpose. And if you don't fulfill the purpose, if you don't take this challenge, you're going to look for purpose somewhere. You're going to pour yourself into your career. You're going to look for satisfaction in, you know, money or power or status, fame, whatever, like sexual conquest. You're going to look for meaning somewhere, and I promise you, you're going to come up empty. You're not going to find it anywhere because you were made for one purpose. A hammer can work as a paperweight, but that's not what it's designed to do. You can do all kinds of things in life. Many of them are really great. You can do a bunch of really meaningful things, but you were made for one thing that surpasses all of those things. You were made for you on Galitzo. You were made to share the good news, to declare the praises of the God who called you out of darkness and into wonderful light. And as you, like with, I don't want to just give you a challenge and give you nothing practical. One practical step that I want to tell you is, as you go and try to share what God's done in your life, don't force it. Please don't force it. I know some of you have grown up in a church background where maybe you felt like you had to be a door-to-door Jesus salesman and give some kind of like rehearsed speech. I want you to know that like what I'm talking about today is genuinely caring for people and showing them that there's hope walking alongside them. This is not a pyramid scheme for Jesus. You're not earning heaven points or like platinum afterlife status or something like that. That's not real. It's just playing the long game of walking beside somebody and caring for them and showing them, like, I sympathize with where you're at, and I think Jesus has something to say about it. I think that there's still hope for you. I found it. You don't have to force it, okay? One time when I was in seminary, I took a class on evangelism, and one of the assignments was was in the next 14 days, go and share the gospel with two people that don't know Jesus. And I had a deadline. I had to write a paper on it and everything. And to this day, I'm sort of disappointed with that assignment. It forced me to bend a conversation where it wouldn't have otherwise gone. I sat down with a friend of mine and I just bent the conversation towards you. I Jesus-juked him. Do you know what a Jesus-juke is? It's like when they're talking about something totally normal and you're just like, you just pivot it to Jesus when it didn't even make sense, just to try to have a spiritual conversation. And I forced a spiritual conversation and I didn't handle it well. I tried to do it with like the right heart, but truthfully, there was a part of me that's like, I just gotta do it. I don't know. I gotta try it because I gotta write a paper because I gotta get a good grade. And so I forced a conversation and I hurt a relationship and I regret it to this day. You don't have to force it, okay? In fact, if you force it, you'll probably experienced, like, I don't know, I think I might've botched that up. I'd love to give you some steps that make you more likely to get a W. These are not tactics. This is a loving encouragement to care well for people, okay? We don't strategize about how to trick people into Jesus. We're not baiting and switching. It's just a strategy, a helpful tool to lay some groundwork relationally that you might have an open door to share Jesus, okay? It's this acronym that we use that's BLESS, okay? The last S stands for share. Like, share your story, your testimony of how God changed your life. And through it, share that Jesus is the way, that He has good news for us. But if that step is terrifying, and I understand why it can be. I used to feel that way. If that's terrifying, then start at the top. Everybody in the room can do this. B is just begin with prayer. Just pray. Pray for the person, like like every day. Pray that God would start to turn their heart toward him. Pray that God would open opportunities for you to care well for them. And as you pray for them, a funny thing happens. God starts to change your heart. He starts to open your eyes and you start to see opportunities that you never saw before. Crazy that when you don't look for opportunities, none present themselves. Shocker, right? But when you open your eyes and look for opportunities, they are there. The second one is listen more than you talk. I'm not great at this. I talk a lot. I'm trying in the season to get better at asking good questions and then just listening. And when I listen, I hear people say, man, I'm just, I'm not doing well. I'm stressed. I'm so busy and tired. Work is killing me. Things are not going well at home. Whatever it is. And it leads to conversations that mean an awful lot more than just shooting the breeze or talking about football. I like football. I don't mind shooting the breeze. But some conversations matter more, and this opens the door to some of those. E is for eat with them. A lot of those e is for eat with them a lot of great conversations happen around tables where you just kick back and enjoy time with one another you can invite your co-worker out to hey come let's let's get lunch you can tell your neighbor like man we're going to grill out but we got way too many brats you want to come over and hang out eat with them and just see see if there's opportunity to care well for them the first s is for serve i know sometimes in our world here you may have neighbors that don't have obvious physical needs if my neighbor's plumbing breaks they don't call me a because i don't know anything about plumbing b because they have money and they can hire a plumber like they don't need me to meet their obvious physical needs but that doesn't mean that there's not a way to serve them and care for them. Become the kind of coworker that wakes up 15 minutes early and goes and buys whatever coffee drink your friend at work wants and bring it to them. Just show care. Become the kind of neighbor that watches your neighbor's kids so they can go out on a date. I don't know. Get creative with it, but find ways to serve and care for people. And if you will do this stuff, if you will actually be in the lives of people, and you're gonna have to make room in your schedule for it, I know, I know you're part of the people that are just so busy all the time, I know. But if you'll make room in your schedule and make room in your heart for these people, I promise you God's gonna continue to open up doors where you can care for them and ultimately share. Share the fact that Jesus changed your life. Share part of your story. Hear their story and share part of yours. Your story and how God intersected it, God's story, the gospel, can rewrite the ending to their story. If you don't know how to share your story, there's not like one magic way, but if you just want some help and you're like, I don't even know where to begin, this sounds self-promoting and I don't mean it that way at all, but I preached a message here last October. I think it was last October. You can find it at befearless.org that was about sharing what God's done in our lives. Go check it out. Like, we walk through some of those things. If you don't wanna watch the message, come talk to me. I'll do a training. caring well for other people, and sharing the good news. The world desperately needs the good news. I want you to know that you can do this, okay? I told you not to force it, and I know sometimes that can sort of be an excuse for why we don't actually do anything. Like, well, I just didn't want to force it. Like, the opportunity didn't present itself, so I didn't do anything. I don't want this to be an excuse for this. You still got to act with urgency. This message still matters. It matters for today. The hope of Jesus is not hope for someday. It's hope for today. He doesn't just change my afterlife. He changes my here, now, today life. We can act with urgency. In fact, lots of you are in this room because somebody cared enough to help walk you through some of this. Maybe it was a family member or a friend or whatever. I don't know. Maybe they shared part of their story. Maybe they invited you to church. Maybe they said, you ever want to just like read the Bible and explore matters of faith? I don't know what they did, but there's people here in this room. You're here because somebody reached out to you they were sent and now your eternity has changed this matters when i started uh two years ago when i had that midlife clarity moment almost said crisis midlife clarity moment and decided i want my life to be about the main thing i started just saying like okay god like i i don't know how to do this and i'm a little scared about it but i'm just going to try and you know what I found? You can share with so much confidence. You don't have to be scared. I thought people would like hate me. I used to like hide the fact that I was a pastor. I'd tell people like, I work with people. I don't know, I try to avoid telling them the truth that I'm a pastor because like i'm some religious freak or something but if you just care well for people they're very open to hearing about like what god's done in your life i've prayed with so many people uh like i just you know whatever it was that was going on your life that's that's awful like do you mind i'm gonna pray for you as i drive away but do you want to just pray now we pray together and they'll text later and be like man that is exactly what i needed there's so many people like people need hope god has opened. There's so many people, like people need hope. God has opened the door to so many awesome conversations where I just get to tell people, like not forcefully, not judgmentally, but just, he's changed my life. It made a difference for this one. I think it can make a difference for you. I'm willing to stake my life on this thing. I think Jesus is the way. You can go out there and share with confidence. Paul says, everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. That's a great promise. What an awesome promise. But how's it going to work? How can they call on him if they don't believe? And how can they believe if they haven't heard? And how are they going to hear if no one tells them? And who's going to tell them unless somebody is sent? You are sent. It's you. The plan works when you go. You were made for action. You weren't made for a lackluster religious life. You were made for action. You were made for purpose. And I promise you, when you live this purpose out, when you get a W, it's going to change everything. Someday, when you get a W, it's gonna change everything. Someday, when you tell somebody about Jesus and they walk through some steps, again, it's not some magical switch that flips, like it might take some time, you walk through this process, but when you tell somebody about Jesus and they finally say, you know what? I do believe. I wanna call on the Lord. When you change their eternity and you get that W in that area, I promise you, you're going to realize in a hurry, this is what I was made for. Nothing else is going to satisfy me. Nothing else matters this much. This is what I was made for. You are sent. You were made for action. Will you pray with me? God, I pray that you would move us to action. You'd motivate us, break us out of any kind of ruts that we're in. Any part of our faith that feels lifeless, God, I pray that we would put action to it and that you would wake us up. Open doors so that we might be in relationships with people. And again, not because they're not our projects. I don't get a notch in my belt every time somebody comes to the Lord. Like, that's not what this is. I just want to care for people. I've just seen how good the good news is, and I want other people to know it. I share your heart, God. I want everybody to come to knowledge of the truth of who you are. God, move us in that direction. People need to know it. People need to know it. People need to know that they're loved. People need to know that they can have a fresh start, that you're the God of second chances, that you can wipe the slate clean, that you can change everything. People need to know it. Help us go and do what you've called us to, God. This is what we were made for. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Amen."}]}

So it was December 1988. I was 10 years old and Christmas was right around the corner. So of course, I start bugging my parents. I said, mom and dad, just one thing I want this year. You don't have to worry about getting me anything else. The one thing I want is the Nintendo Action Set. How many of you remember the Nintendo Action Set? I want to remind you, it included the NES control system. Not one, but two controllers, control system. Not one, but two controllers, the official NES laser light gun, and then the dual pack. You remember this? Duck Hunt and Super Mario Brothers. And I tried to convince my parents. I'm like, this is not so much a want as it is, honestly, it's borderline a need. Like I need this thing. You know what? We need this thing. I showed them the back of the box i said this is not about me this is about our family right i mean i don't have a little brother but if if y'all do give me a little brother clearly i'll play with him like that'll be awesome right this is what we need but unfortunately we had a problem in our family because our family already had a gaming system we had something called the ColecoVision. Yeah, mixed emotions right there. The ColecoVision came out in 1982 and lasted three years because everyone else wanted what? The Nintendo, right? So my parents were like, you know, they were wise or stingy, whatever. They elected not to get me this. And this is probably the reason I've been through regeneration twice now. That's neither here nor there because God has a way. 10 years later, December 19th, 1998, I find myself standing at the altar marrying my very best friend, Christelle. And guess what came with Christelle? An action set! God has a way, right? It was awesome. It's not the reason I married her, but it didn't hurt, right? So our Saturday nights as poor college newlyweds looked like watching an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger, and then playing a few games of Super Mario Brothers which quickly became my very favorite game so there's one Saturday night we watched Walker Texas Ranger right watch Chuck Norris do things that only Chuck Norris can do and then we start playing a few rounds of Super Mario Brothers we neither of us were very good at it you know I'd never really played the game a whole lot. But then it happened. It happened one faithful Saturday night. Check this out. That's kind of cool. Hey, wait a second. Look at this. What's going on? Wait, did you hear that sound? What does one up mean? This is getting kind of exciting, right? What is happening right now? It's the best Saturday night ever, right? and already know this, you know what I'm about to say, but those of you that are not, you need to know this. In World 3, Level 1, there is a way to get multiple extra men, and I'm talking 99 extra men, extra lives to be able to win this game. So I knew, I hit the 99 mark and I'm like, ha ha, tonight is the night. I am winning this game. So I quickly navigate myself to world two, level two. You remember this? The warp zone boom to go to level eight, the final world, right? Four levels in world eight. And world eight was difficult. It should be the most challenging. I'd been to level one and level two of world eight, but never been to level three. So I'll be honest with you. I get to level three and i start losing men left and right like i'm trying to figure out how to play the game christelle and i take turns as we're playing this game and long story short somehow we made it to the final battle with bowser and i'm telling you all you have to do is and don't say you didn't learn something at church all you have to do is get over here and jump on this thing and the princess is right over here. She's waiting for you, right? You win the whole thing. And I got 12 men left. There's no way I can lose. And then I kept losing till I finally get down to the last three men that I have. And I'm frustrated. I'm still trying to recover from anger and so I and shaking the thing and all the things you do, right? When you're frustrated. And my wife says to me, Chris, I don't know what you need to do, but you need to do something different. You keep losing. And she was right. And guess what? I didn't do the right different things because that night I did not rescue the princess. I did not win Super Mario Brothers. In fact, you may think less of me and some of you may leave or log off right now. I have never won Super Mario Brothers. I've never saved the princess. She's lived in there for a long time. I've never been able to save the princess. Now, just keep in mind before you judge me too much, we were newlyweds, so I was pursuing other passions. And we sold the thing in a garage sale because we were poor college students. So that's the story, right? But that night, I'll never forget. I did learn an extremely important life lesson. I learned that nothing will change and you'll keep getting the same results unless you do something different. Today we're kicking off a new message series entitled Fresh Start. The Old Testament prophet, Jeremiah, he would say it this way. He would say, great is God's faithfulness. You can trust God's faithfulness any time and all the time. His mercies are fresh and new each morning. Our God is the God of the fresh start. He's the God of second chances. He's the God of the redo. He wants to give you and I the start over the fresh start we need. And this is really, really good news for every one of us, because at some point in your life, at some point in my life, we have all needed a fresh start. And I don't know what it is for you as you sit here, as you watch online this morning. For a lot of us, we need a fresh start in school. And it's about to happen. A lot of schools are about to go back to college, back to elementary, whatever school it might be, teachers, administrators, faculty, staff, parents, students. Maybe you're looking forward and you're like, man, this is a fresh start. Last year was a little tough. There were some challenges, this and that, and you're looking for a fresh start. For some of us, maybe it's our career. The biggest thing on your mind right now is the frustration you have at work. And you're thinking, dude, you're speaking my have a fresh, I wish I could go a whole different direction or at least a new job. Or some of you might say, well, it's not so much a new job or a new career, if I could just start this position over, like if I could rerun my life like eight months and just make some different decisions, if I could just have a fresh start. For some of us, it's harder, it's recovery stuff. I mean, you're to you, sometimes honestly things done by you. And you just wish you could have a fresh start. For those of us where it's like a relationship, you might be sitting here today and you're like, I cannot believe he's talking about this. Because this is the first day after that relationship ended. You're like, man, that was a tough thing for me. And I, or maybe it's not the first day. Maybe you're just here and you're just trying to meet some friends. You're like, man, this Jesus and God and Bible and all that kind of, it's kind of cool. But honestly, I'm really here because I don't have any, I had like just a fresh start with a friendship. What I had like just a fresh start with a friendship. What about this? What about our fresh start with God? Some of you, you're here and you think, man, if I could just get back to where I was. There's a time in your life, maybe it was weeks ago, maybe it was honestly decades ago where you felt like, man, me and God, we were close. I felt like I heard him and he walked with him and it felt like he was with me. Or maybe you're trying to get away from somewhere you should never have been. There's some stuff going on in your life that no one knows about. And you're just like, man, I don't know if God even wants me anymore, but if he does, man, I really would like a fresh start with God. I mean, what, what, what would that look like to have a fresh start with God. And I don't know, I think about things as I was praying and preparing this week. I thought for some of us, I know for me, sometimes it's overcoming sin. Sin is anytime we disobey God. And sometimes I get in these cycles where like I commit a sin against God, against other people. A couple of weeks later, that sin comes back up. A couple days later, a couple hours later, it just kind of like this sin cycle. And it's one of the reasons I try to encourage you all the time to read the Bible because there's very important stuff, very practical stuff. The apostle Paul, he had a similar struggle. Listen to what he said to the church in Rome. He said, I wanna do what's good, but I don't. You ever been there before? I don't wanna do what's wrong, but I do it anyway. He said, look, I've discovered this principle of life. When I wanna do what's right, for some reason I inevitably do what's wrong. I love God's law with all my heart. And some of you are like that. You're watching right now and you're like, man, I do love the word of God. I wanna do it God's way, but man, something happens. There seems like there's another power, something going on inside of me. And it's altering my mind, my thoughts. And this power makes me a slave to sin and disobedience that obviously is still a part of me. Oh, what a miserable person I am. I think when we struggle with these unbroken sin cycles, we feel defeated, disconnected from God. Maybe for you today, a fresh start with God would look like overcoming sin. in sin cycles, we feel defeated, disconnected from God. Maybe for you today, a fresh start with God would look like overcoming sin. For others, you'd say, I'm not saying I'm perfect, but it's not really like a sin issue. Like for me, it's overcoming stagnation. You'd say, I don't know how to explain it other than I'm just stuck. Like if I'm really honest about my relationship with God, I'm just going through the motions. And you would say to me, man, I could totally relate to what Jesus said when he was talking to the church in Ephesus. He told them, he said, look, I know all the things you do. I've seen your hard work, your patient endurance, but I do have this complaint against you. Something's going on. You don't love me or even other people as you did at first. And you're thinking, man, that is a lot like me. There seemed to be this vibrancy in my relationship with Jesus before, but now I'm just stuck. Maybe for you, a fresh start with God looks like overcoming stagnation. For others, it's overcoming fear. We all have, what, a couple of natural responses to fear, right? The fight, flight, freeze. And maybe there's something God is telling you to do. Maybe there's somewhere God is telling you to go. Maybe there's something God is telling you to say to someone and you're scared, honestly, you're scared. So you're fighting with God, arguing with God, running away from God, freezing, because you don't know if you're obedient, if you do what God tells you to do, you don't know how it'll turn out. There's no guarantee to trust him with that much faith. Man, if I leave this job, if I say this in the, whatever it might be and fear, fear just stops you and man, a fresh start with God would look like you overcoming that fear and taking new ground and growing in your faith. Some of you, and this is, man, almost every week this happens in our church family, you got to overcome religion. You or someone you love has been extremely hurt by a follower of Jesus. Usually in the context of something like this church, somebody said something, somebody did something, somebody didn't come through, something happened and you are just hurt. And it's real. You look throughout the history of the world at people that have followed Jesus, the things that have been said and done throughout the history of the world, throughout your history. Those things are hateful and hurtful and horrific. And you're like, man, I, dude, I wouldn't mind a fresh start with God, but I, man, I don't know, man, this organized religion thing. And I don't know, man, I wouldn't mind a fresh start with God, but man, I don't know, man. This organized religion thing, man, I don't know. Look, I don't know what your fresh start with God looks like, but I do know this. I do know this. I believe this all my heart. Nothing will change. And you and I will keep getting the same results unless we do something different. And if God is the God of the fresh start and He wants to offer you, His mercies are new every day, and He's wanting to offer us a fresh start, a redo, a second chance, whatever it is, the question that you and I have to ask ourselves is what do we do with this fresh start? Do we keep doing the same thing or do we do something different? If there ever was a group of people that needed a fresh start, it was God's holy people, the nation of Israel. If you were to study the first 39 historical documents that make up what we call the Old Testament, you would read an amazing story, an amazing history of God's relationship with a specific group of people, the nation Israel. He made a covenant or a promise with them. You can read all about it. You can see it, and especially in Genesis and Exodus, you can see some of the foundations of that promise. As we wrap up Genesis and move into Exodus, you find a family of about 70 people, Jacob and his sons. They move to Egypt and they grow. Unfortunately, they move to Egypt and they grow, unfortunately they grow as a nation underneath the oppression of Egyptian power. And so they are slaves to Egypt for about 400 plus years. And that's how they became a nation, but God delivered them, right? And if you read, you're gonna find this, then basically a sin cycle, very familiar to my life, where you'll find a highly committed group of people to Jesus and then they are to God and Yahweh, and then they disobey and they sin, and then God disciplines them, and then they repent and come back to God time and time again. Well, in the end of the 7th century BC, there's a king, his name is Nebuchadnezzar. You probably remember that name or heard that name, Nebuchadnezzar II. And God is frustrated and honestly angry with the nation of Israel because of their disobedience, because of their idolatry, their pursuit of other gods and other ways to live their life. And so he allows discipline through King Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian empire to overtake the nation Israel and remove them from their homeland and they go into captivity for 70 years. They long for, they yearn for a fresh start. They didn't necessarily defend their action. They knew they had sinned against God, but now they're sitting in the midst of discipline. They desire, they long make it if I could just have a fresh start. And the very tail end of that 70 year time in captivity, God raises up a spokesman, a prophet by the name of Isaiah. And he's gonna speak through Isaiah. And this guy, this prophet comes on the scene and says, God wants to deliver you. He wants to give you a fresh start. In Isaiah chapter 43, we read these words. This is what the Lord says. This is Isaiah speaking. And before he tells us exactly what Yahweh, the Lord wants to say to the nation Israel, he reminds them of who the Lord is. He says, the Lord who makes a way in the sea and a path through the raging water. Now, some of you read that and immediately your mind goes to an event in Israel's history. And you're right. He's talking about the Exodus. In fact, if you've never read it, I encourage you this afternoon, Exodus chapter 14, it'll take you three minutes to read that story. And you'll be very familiar with you're like, yeah, I heard this, or I saw this on TV or a cartoon or something like this, when obviously Moses stands at the edge of the Red Sea, remember he holds up his staff and what does God do? He parts the Red Sea and the nation Israel, they go through that path as he parts it on dry ground. And Isaiah continues on, he says, it's the Lord, it's Yahweh who does what? He brings out the chariot and the horse, the army and the mighty one, that's talking about Pharaoh together. What happened to them? They lied down. They did not rise again. They were extinguished. They were put out like a wick. In other words, they were killed. So some of you might remember this. As the nation Israel crossed on dry ground, they get to the other side of the Red Sea. They turn around and they see the Egyptian army with Pharaoh charging at them. And Great, God did a miracle, but it looks like we're in a lot of trouble. Well, when they all get into the riverbed, the river crushes down on them. The Red Sea just demolishes and kills every single one of them. And so Isaiah is telling to them, it's this Lord, it's Yahweh, the one who rescued you and defeated your enemy. This is what he says. And this is what I think is so interesting. He says, forget all that. Everything I just said, all these memories, forget all that, because it's nothing compared to what I'm going to do soon. What I'm going to do in and through your life. Now, this is kind of weird because any of you that have ever read the Bible know the Bible repeatedly has us learn and remember historical things that God has done in our lives and in the lives of God's people. In fact, the nation Israel was instructed oftentimes to build an altar, to build a memorial, to do something to remind them of God's faithfulness. But here's the problem with the nation Israel at that point, the nation Israel was focused on what God did. They believed, they believed that he rescued previous generations from the hand of the Egyptian army. They believe that story, right? Their struggle, their weakness in their faith was they weren't too sure about what God will do. They had faith in the past, but not in the promise. And I think oftentimes we struggle the same way. I know for my struggle, like I believe God's story. Like I know this may sound crazy, but I really do believe every word in the Bible is true. Like I believe these scientifically impossible, miraculous things. You're like, man, that cannot happen. It's impossible. And I'm like, man, I agree with you, but I think it did happen. I have great faith. The problem I struggle with is i'm not sure if i have much faith in what god will do in my story i got a lot of faith here but i'm not sure about there and this is isaiah's point like you can't just have faith in the past and all that that he's done like you've got to see you got to see what god is doing now because he's doing something new. He wants to bring you a fresh start. And he continues on and he says, look, even now it's coming. Do you not see it? Do you not see what God will do? Continues on, he says, indeed, indeed, I will make a way in the wilderness, rivers in the desert. Indeed, I'm about to make a path. I'm about to deliver you. I'm about to give you a fresh start. Now, who or what is this way in the wilderness? Well, a few paragraphs before we can read in Isaiah chapter 40, God's description of Isaiah. Check it out. You'll probably recognize it if you've been in church any amount of time. There's a voice of one crying out, prepare the way of the Lord where in the wilderness, make a straight highway for our God in the desert. Now, the immediate prophecy fulfillment of this passage of scripture is Isaiah. Isaiah is this voice. He's the one, just like we're reading in Isaiah 43, he's the one standing there saying, God is about to make a way. He's gonna deliver us. God is going to give us a fresh start. But there is also a distant prophecy being made here, an immediate and a distant. You often see that within the old covenant or Old Testament, an immediate fulfillment of the prophecy and a distant fulfillment. Now, if we were to fast forward some 500 years to the first century, one of the prophecy and a distant fulfillment. Now, if we were to fast forward some 500 years to the first century, one of the closest disciples of Jesus was a man by the name of John, the apostle John. You probably heard of him, right? And John wrote the gospel of John. So you got John, he also wrote first, second, and third John and Revelation. So this is an important individual because we believe this guy, empowered by the spirit of God, have written us holy scriptures that we can understand and know God. Well, John describes to us an event and a reply by another John, known as John the Baptist. And let me show you what he says. He says, this was John the Baptist. He's talking about John the baptizer, right? The testimony, when the Jews from Jerusalem sent priests, excuse me, and Levites to ask him, who are you? Now, when John the Baptist showed up on the scene in the first century, it had been some 400 years since the nation of Israel, since the Jews had heard from a prophet of God. So they felt like God is so silent. And all of a sudden, John the Baptist comes and he comes prophesying. And so they're all finding out. In fact, the Jewish leaders, the priests are like, who are you? And watch John's reply. He said, look, I am, recognize this, a voice of one crying out in the wilderness. What am I crying out? Prepare the way of the Lord. And I'm saying it just as Isaiah the prophet said. So just like Isaiah said so many years before, at this point, this would have been 500 years before. Isaiah told you god wants to deliver you isaiah told you god wants to rescue you god told you through isaiah that he wants to give you a fresh start in the same way i john the baptizer am coming as a prophet to tell you like a voice crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord adonai you know he's talking about not yahweh he's talking about jesus jesus is coming on the scene to make a way for jew and gentile alike to make a way to give you and i a fresh start he's saying in that same spirit the new thing god wants to give you is a fresh start. He's saying in that same spirit, the new thing God wants to give you is a fresh start through Jesus Christ. The apostle Paul describes it so well. He says, when it comes to you and I experiencing a fresh start with God, a fresh start in life through Jesus Christ, it looks like this. He says, since we believe that Christ died for all of us, heard that before, the idea that Jesus died on the cross, not for his own sin, but for all of our sins. He dies on the cross. We also believe something that we have all died to our old life. Paul further explains. Watch what he says. He says, Jesus died for everyone so that those who receive this new life, so those who have a fresh start in their relationship with God, they no longer live for themselves. Instead, they do something different. Specifically, what do they do different? The apostle Paul tells us. He says, they live for Jesus Christ who died and was raised for them. In summary, Paul says it's like this. What this means is this means that anyone who belongs to Jesus Christ has become a new person. You enter a relationship with Jesus Christ, you get a fresh start. You enter a relationship with Jesus Christ, you get a fresh start. And if anybody knew that it was the apostle Paul. Paul was at one time called Saul and Saul was notorious for leading in the execution of orders to arrest and imprison and even kill followers of Jesus. Then he had this divine encounter with Jesus Christ and it radically changed his life. And he would tell us his own story. I'm a new person. I have a fresh start. The old life is gone. Past failure. Past stagnation. That is no longer part of my life. I've overcome that. Instead, a new life has begun. And because of this new life, I get to do something different. So let me ask you something. Let me ask you something. If God is offering you and me a fresh start, a fresh start, a new beginning, a redo, what is the something different that you'll do? What if in your fresh start, you did something different? What if you do something different and you actually start a conversation? For some of you online or some of you in this room, this is one of the things I love about our church. I don't know that we always do this well, but we have a passion to try to make this a safe place to search and seek. Following Jesus is a very serious commitment. It's very, we're gonna talk about that in just a moment. It's very serious. And so we don't expect that people hear about Jesus one time and they're like, I'm all in, right? But we realize God is doing some things to answer some of your questions and draw you into knowing and walking with Jesus Christ. And so we wanna create a safe place for you to have a conversation about Jesus. But I wanna challenge you in this. If you're in that category and you say, dude, I don't believe all this stuff right now. Like I don't believe, man, to tell me there was this guy named Jesus from Nazareth who really is the son of God. I mean, I'm not there yet. That's fine. I'm glad you're here. That's fine. I'm glad you're here. I'm glad you're watching online. But here's what I wanna challenge you to do. What if, because remember, nothing will change and you'll keep getting the same results until you do something different. What if you're something different? It's to start a conversation from the position of sincerity, not skepticism. I'm not asking you. I'm not asking you to check your brain at the door. I'm not asking that at all. I'm just saying, think about it. When it comes to God and spiritual matters, some of you are so smart and you're coming to the table with skepticism. And when you come to the table, asking, talking, a discussion with somebody and you're a skeptic, the discussion ends and the debate begins. and the debate begins. You dig in your hills, they dig in their hills and no one is listening to each other. But what if for just a season, what if it was just the rest of this year? What is that? Four or five months. What if you just said, you know what? Fine. With all sincerity, I'm gonna start a conversation. I'm gonna start a conversation and I'm gonna talk about God. And you find other followers of Jesus and you just start asking them, Hey, what's, what's your story? Why did you decide to follow Jesus? And just listen, even if things they say are crazy, you're like, man, I don't believe that. That's crazy. Just listen, ask questions and realize this. Just don't forget this. They're on their journey too. If they tell you, dude, I'm so glad you came to the right place. Not only am I perfect, but I have all the answers. You have my permission to lightly slap them. And what you don't know is they have to turn the other cheek, so you get to slap them twice. It's awesome, it's awesome. No, don't trust people that tell you they're perfect or have all the answers. Just be polite, walk away, don't slap them. I'll get emails on that. But anyway, like seriously, what if you just came with sincerity and you said, I wanna find out your story. And what if you not just talk about God? What if, and I know this is weird, but what if you talk to God? And I'll admit, if you're in this category and you're like, dude, I'm just seeking. I'm not even sure if I wanna have a conversation. Like I admit praying is weird, right? I admit you're talking out loud or in your own mind to someone you can't even see and hear and you're like, this is weird. But listen to what Jesus says. Jesus says this. He says, if you'll keep on asking, guess what's going to happen? You're going to receive what you asked for. Like if you'll keep on seeking, it's probably going to be more than a few weeks. You'll find you keep on knocking, the door will be open. Why? Why Jesus? Look at this promise. Because everyone doesn't matter who they are. Everyone who asks eventually receives. Everyone who seeks eventually finds. Everyone who knocks the door will be open. What if you sincerely seek? And you start talking to God and you just pray. I mean, just pray. Don't overcomplicate it. Don't have big churchy words. Just, God, I don't overcomplicate it. Don't have big churchy words. Just, God, I don't know you. I wanna know you. If you're real, I don't even know if you're real. God, I don't believe you're real, but if you're real, I wanna know. I wanna know. And that guy on the stage talked about having a relationship. That's kind of weird. Like, what would that look and you listen so talk to god through prayer listen to god through his word so i'm going to give you two really easy things you can do the first one first one i just want you to come back you don't have to join our church in fact in september you can stop coming to nurture i'm not trying to get our church to grow real big and all this kind of stuff no i'm saying for you for you what i want for you is to have a chance to practically say okay what does it look like to have a chance to practically say, okay, what does it look like to have a fresh start? So the next three weeks, we're going to get more practical. What does it look like to have a fresh start with God, with his people? What does that look like? So we want to help answer that question. And then the second thing, it's a little more difficult. I want to challenge you to read God's word. I want to challenge you. If you start today in the gospel of John, it's a great place to start. You all about Jesus. And if you do one chapter a day, which will take you about 10 minutes, one chapter a day, you'll be on chapter 21, which is the final chapter on the last day of this series. So you could start today, it's easy. You could say, all right, I'm gonna pray. God, I don't really know you. You get a pen and paper out, you read those chapter and you just write down some thoughts, some questions with sincerity, not skepticism, just for a season, sincerely. Like what if for you, a fresh start with God looked like you being willing to do something different, start a conversation, talk about God, talk to God. What if a fresh start for you meant that you were gonna do something different and actually start a relationship? See, our relationships are always a natural response meant that you were gonna do something different and actually start a relationship. See, our relationships are always a natural response to our conversations. When you have a sincere conversation, repeated sincere conversations with someone, you develop a relationship. So much so in our culture and every culture that I know eventually gives that person a title. So they were a stranger. Now we've had some great conversations, some memories, some moments together. And now I call that person a friend. Or maybe some of you even said this, man, I've had some serious conversations with people. I will actually say, man, Joe here, this is my brother. And I'm not talking about my physical brother. This is my brother, man. I trust him, he trusts me. Man, our conversations have led to a serious relationship and all healthy relationships involve mutual commitment. And here's Jesus's commitment to you. He went all in. He said, I so much want you to know, love and follow me that I will give my life. He died on the cross. He gave the ultimate sacrifice of his life. He says, my commitment to you is sacrifice of my life. And then he turns around. And I don't know if people have told you about this, but Jesus turns around and he says, now what I want from you is the same thing, an all-in commitment of a sacrifice of your life. Listen to the way Jesus said it. He said, if you wanna be my follower, awesome, that's great. It's not just a belief system. It it's not just a belief system it's not just signing up on a card he says no you must turn from your selfish ways you're no longer living your way of life your wishes your wants your desires he said instead you're going to take up your cross daily you're going to daily identify with my death burial and resurrection and your own death saying i'm not living for myself and you're going to follow me you're going to obey me in every way he said it's simple it's like this if you try to hang on to your life, if you try to hang on and halfway follow me, it doesn't work. You're gonna lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you go all in, you will save it. And this is intense. Jesus doesn't ask us to do something that he's not willing to do. He says, I'm gonna sacrifice my life. You sacrifice your life, you go all in, your wishes, your wants, your desires. I become king, I become Lord, I become ruler in your life. See, starting a relationship with Jesus means that we position Jesus to be our king, to be our Lord, to be our master, to be our boss. We are making a commitment and it is a commitment to pursuit, not perfection. I think this is where a lot of people get confused. They say, man, I gotta be perfect to know and follow Jesus. No, Jesus was perfect. He died because you are not, and neither am I. We don't have to be perfect, but he does demand we pursue. And you can do this. Let me tell you, that's my story. I don't know, honestly, to be completely transparent, I don't know if I've ever lived a day without sinning against God. Yet I stand here and I would tell you, man, I really do feel in my heart and I think in my mind, I love Jesus, I'm committed to Him, I'm all in. Like I've moved my family, my life, I've done things because I love Jesus, but yet I still can't go a day without disobeying Him. I'm not perfect, but I can tell you this. I'm gonna wake up tomorrow with a passion to pursue, to know Him better, to love Him more, to obey Him more. And when I fall, not if I fall, my commitment is to get up, allow God to dust off my knees and give me a fresh start. And I'm gonna take that fresh start. Then what if your fresh start with God looked like doing something different and you started a relationship, a real commitment to pursue knowing, loving, following Jesus Christ. Finally, what if a fresh start with you looked like doing something different and starting to take new ground? And what I mean by that is, it's good for us to have a conversation about God, with God, right? It's good for us to know and love Jesus, but at some point, at some point, if we're ever gonna overcome stagnation, if we're gonna ever overcome just going through the motions and being stuck in our relationship, at some point we have to fight tooth and nail and do whatever it takes to fight complacency and take new ground. And that take new ground always looks like you and I surrendering more of our life and obeying more of his commands. I love the way that James, he just kind of throws a left hook and he says, look, you can't just listen to God's word. Like going to a Bible study, you're gonna learn some more. You might even impress a bunch of people. You might be able to quote scripture. You might be able to preach. You might be able to do all kinds of things. But he says, you gotta do what it says. If you and I don't go all in and we don't commit to take new ground and be more obedient in every area of our life, he said, we're only fooling ourselves. The reality, our faith is fake. It's not real. He said, faith by itself isn't enough. If it doesn't produce a transformed, changed life, a good life, good deeds, not perfection, but pursuit, then it's dead and it's useless. Look, faith, real faith is always going to move us. Faith is always going to strive to take new ground, to obey Christ more. Whatever he's telling you to do, you're like, man, it's scary. I don't know, but I can overcome fear. When you overcome that fear and you step out and you trust him before you know it, you're walking on water. Like, man, I can't believe this. What God is doing in and through my life. What if you, what if your fresh start included taking new ground? Here's the reality. Faith is always gonna move us forward. It's always gonna look like taking more ground. Real faith is always gonna do something different. So if these three, which is it you need to do? With sincerity, starting a conversation. With sacrifice, starting a commitment. Or with surrender, starting to obey in an area that you never have. Look, this is what the Lord says I'm about to do to something new. I wanna give you a fresh start. Can't you see it? Don't you see what God will do? And here's what I promised you. I promised you nothing will change and you will keep getting the same results until you do something different. So what is it? What's the something different you're willing to do? If God's giving you a fresh start, what's the something? As we start a new semester, a new season, as tomorrow you start a new day, what would it look like for you to take new ground and grow in your faith? What could you do? Imagine, what could you do? Imagine, what could you do? Imagine who you could become if this time, this time, when given the fresh start, this time, you do something different."}]}

It was a summer job. Anybody have any happy memories, fun stories to tell about the BMV? No, right? It's got a bad reputation. Nobody likes the BMV. Nobody wants to go there. You know it's going to be a place that tests your patience. You walk in, and you know you're going to wait in a line for eternity. You grab a ticket. It says you're number 47. You look up at the screen. It says serving I-19. Like, is it bingo like mine doesn't even have a letter on it I don't know if I'm in the right line But you just sit there and you wait for forever and you finally get up to the counter And you know what happens you don't have the right paperwork, right? You were supposed to bring eight proofs of residence and your mom's birth certificate a blood sample or whatever whatever you're supposed to have You don't have it and they send you away in shame You have to hang your head and just sulk out of this place and go live to fight another day. You're emotionally broken, right? Nobody wants to go to the BMV. And I worked with a bunch of people there that had worked there for a very long time, just a summer job for me, but they had been there for a long time. And you can imagine what that environment does to people, right? I feel like they were what I imagine people would be like when they come back from war. Like they had seen things that they can't unsee and it left them just dark, stone-hearted, angry at the world kind of people. And they would argue with the customers and the customers would argue with them. It was an ugly environment. And I'm just trying to keep a low profile there. Mostly I answered the phones. I worked on the driver's exam side and my title was clerk. And so I would answer the phone so many times a day. Lima driver's exam station, Clerk Missler speaking, may I help you? I would answer it so many times. I would get out my own phone later that evening and I would accidentally answer that. Lima driver's exam station, clerk Missler speaking, may I help you? And you say it so many times, you start to say it pretty fast and something would happen. I would answer the phone, Lima driver's exam station, clerk Missler speaking, may I help you? And they would say, oh, hi, Clark. Hey, listen Clark. My name's Matt. I'm Matt. I'm not Clark. But what am I going to interrupt them and correct them? It seems weird to do that, right? I'm not going to say, you know, before we go any further, I just want you to know my name is Matt. It doesn't matter. Who cares, right? It's not a problem until it is. They come in later that day or later that week, whenever think on the driver's test side that our clientele was mostly 15-year-old girls who were excited to get their temps, but it wasn't. It was mostly guys who had committed crimes and lost their license and had fought with the courts, and it was a whole ordeal. They're trying to get their life back in order. It's been a stressful thing, and they get in line, and they wait for what feels like eternity, and they finally get up to the counter, and you know what happens. They don't have the right paperwork and they lose it I mean they start yelling where is Clark I talked to Clark on the phone and Clark told me that all I need to bring with they lose it and my co-workers are like please lower the tone of your voice sir there is nobody by the name of Clark it nobody I don't know who you talk to but Clark is not here and I just sit over at my desk like hiding I'm like faking a phone call or something I'm trying trying to avoid all that heat over there. I don't want any of it. And I never said a word. And this didn't happen just once. This happened every week. New people would come in and they'd be like, well, I talked to Clark and Clark promised me this. And Clark told me that. Who was Clark? And the legend of Clark grew. Everybody is wanting to know? Who is this guy? They need to know the mystery. Everybody wanted to know. And I feel, I was a new Christian at the time. I think maybe the Holy Spirit was stuck in beginner mode or something because I didn't, he didn't convict me of it at all. I never said anything. I never told anybody. They're finding out right now if they're viewing on the live stream. I never said a word and I felt guilty about it later in life. Like I probably should have manned up and taken some responsibility, but I didn't. Until just recently, I started reading through Luke with you guys again. And I started to realize there's a lot of parallels here, man. Jesus kept a low profile. Like I'm starting to feel like I'm just walking in the footsteps of Jesus. Everywhere I see Jesus, he's healing somebody. And then he's like, don't tell anybody. And they're like, but you're the son of God, right? He's like, shh, just keep that between you and me for right now. He's trying to keep a low profile too. I feel good about it. I feel vindicated. All through the book of Luke, all through the book of Luke. Here, I feel like this is a little crooked. All In Luke 4, they're saying like, who is he that even evil spirits obey him? Who is this guy that he can forgive sins? Who does he think he is? That's blasphemy. Who is this guy that the disciples are terrified? Who is he? What kind of man is this that the wind and the waves obey him? Herod says, who is this guy that I keep hearing these stories about? I keep hearing about his miracles. I keep hearing his fame spreading. I don't think I like that I hear people saying that he's John the Baptist he ain't John the Baptist because I beheaded that guy but who is this guy who is this Jesus the whole region needs to know who is Jesus they're asking the question and in that context Jesus asked a question of his own in fact it's the most important question ever asked because it's the most important question ever asked by the most important person who ever walked earth and so we ought we would be wise today to pay attention to the question, right? If this is the most important question ever uttered, we ought to pay attention. Here's the context. Jesus sends his disciples out. They had just gone out to neighboring villages and they're telling people what they've seen. He sent them out to tell the good news. The good news at this point is that they've seen Jesus heal people, cast out demons. He raised a widow's son from the dead. I mean, he's doing some crazy things. They go out and tell people and they come back and Jesus says, all right, now that you've come back, we're leaving the crowds. We go off, disciples, just you and I. And he asked them this question, who do people say I am? That's not the most important question ever, but bear with me okay so he says who do people say i am give me a report what are they saying out there and the disciples reply well some say you're john the baptist some say elijah others say you're one of the other ancient prophets risen from the dead and then jesus says the most important question of all time he says yeah but who do you say i am i hear what they're saying but who do you say i am and that question is the most important question you will ever grapple with. The answer, your answer to that question determines the course of the rest of your life. It's gonna determine the trajectory of your life. It's gonna make every decision for you. It's the lens through which you view this world. It could not have more implications for your day-to-day life, and I'm not trying to be overdramatic right now, but I don't know how to undersell this. At Fearless Church, we believe that it not only determines your experience in this life, it also determines how you're going to experience the next life. Are you going to be with Jesus in paradise for eternity, or will you be eternally separated from him in hell? It sounds dramatic, it sounds crazy, but that is what we believe. This question could not have higher stakes. A.W. Tozer says it this way. Actually, he's a smart guy. You know, A.W. Tozer had another quote. He said, a scared world needs a fearless church. We named this place after his quote. This is another quote of his. He says, what comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us. Your answer to the question that Jesus asks, who do you say I am, is the most important thing about you. It will determine the trajectory of this life and your experience of the life to come. We cannot afford to mess it up. The stakes are too high. And in fact, I would like for you to imagine something with me as we sort of go through the message today, however uncomfortable it might be, I'm gonna ask that you would picture in your head for a moment, years, decades from now, whenever it is that you breathe your last. Your days on earth are done and you stand before Jesus. I don't know what it's gonna look like. I don't know if there's a big crowd or a line. Maybe you gotta take a ticket like at the BMV. I don't know, but you wait in the great BMV in the sky and you eventually get up to the counter and Jesus is there, okay? Jesus is there. You come face to face with him, and now he's gonna be the one to determine, do you have the right paperwork? You got the right stuff to get? Are you in or out? He is gonna determine that. Keep that picture in your head, and we're gonna jump into Matthew 7, Jesus' teaching, and he says, not everyone who calls out to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven. It's not just about what you say. I don't need your empty words. In other words, he says, not everyone who just says they're a Christian gets in. There's a bunch of people that say they're a Christian. That doesn't mean they get in. He goes on and he says, only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter. And I don't know if you're like me, but I see that. And I'm pretty task-oriented. Give me a to-do list, and I'll start knocking things off the list. God, what do I need to do? Jesus, tell me, what do I need to do? And he goes on, he continues teaching about people who will not get in. He says, on judgment day, many will say to me, Lord, Lord, we prophesied in your name. We did some sensational religious activity, some sensational spiritual acts in your name. It'd be like us saying, I went to church in your name. I tried to work on my marriage at Re-Engage in your name. I volunteered in kids' ministry when they guilted me enough in your name. Like I tried to do some religious activity. And honestly, if you try to stack up your spiritual resume against theirs, how many demons you cast out this week? spiritual resume against theirs how many demons you cast out this week how what's your what's your miracle total for 2023 so far like they're doing more than us guys they're doing crazy sensational religious acts and jesus says that's not enough i don't need your empty words i don't need your empty works he goes on and he says to all those people with empty words and empty works oh sorry he skipped that who cares uh he says i will tell them plainly, I never knew you. I never knew you. Just because you say I'm Lord, just because you do church activity, that's not how you get in. You gotta know me. To those people who have empty words and empty works, I will say, I never knew you. You gotta get away from me. Put simply, people who know Jesus get in. We have to know him. We have to know him and knowing him is not the same as knowing about him. I don't need to know some Jesus trivia to get in my relationship with Jesus is not trivial. Knowing about somebody is not the same as knowing somebody, you know, who I know a lot about LeBron James. I've watched LeBron James his whole career. LeBron James is a great basketball player. He's a 19 time all-star it's all-star weekend right now. I watched the Slam Dunk contest last night. It was awesome. He's a 19-time All-Star. He's a four-time NBA champion, a four-time MVP. He's won two gold medals. He just passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He's the leading scorer in NBA history. He's also top five in assists. Like, I know some stuff about LeBron James, but I don't know who I am. He doesn't know who I, I don't have a relationship with him, right? Knowing about somebody is not a relationship. What Jesus wants from us is a relationship. He values the relational more than the sensational acts. Chris Williams wasn't here today to make one of these slides that rhymes like he likes to do, so I just did this in honor of Chris Williams. One of these cute pastor slides that rhymes. It's still true. Jesus values the relational over the sensational. We gotta know him. Let me give you an example for people that are married in the room today. Your wedding day was sensational, but your marriage is relational, right? The wedding day was amazing. The dress, the makeup, the hair, the music, the cake, the flowers, whatever, it all went well probably. I don't know, It's usually a disaster. But for some of you, you probably have really great memories of it. What a sensational day. But imagine for a second that you stood on a stage and a pastor had you say the vows. You said your vows to one another and he says, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride and everybody cheers for you and they play the music, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, and you march out, everybody's losing their minds, throwing the confetti, it's an exciting time, and then you get in two separate cars and you drive away and you never speak to each other ever again. Do you have a marriage? You don't have a marriage. You had one sensational day, but you don't have a relationship. A relationship is ongoing, daily, getting to know him. This is what Jesus wants from us. And it leads us back to the question. We need to have a relationship to know him. Do you know him? What is your answer to the question that Jesus asks? Who do you say I am? It's a question that's supposed to be pointed at your hearts today. It was also a question asked to the disciples 2000 years ago, and I wanna see what they say. So he asked them, who do you say I am? And Peter jumps up to reply first, and he says, you are the Messiah sent from God. We're reading this in the book of Luke right now. Matthew also records this story, and in Matthew's account, Jesus says, that's right, Peter. Ding, ding, ding, right answer. I am the Messiah, but you didn't get that answer yourself. You got that answer from God. God gave you that answer. You barely know what you're saying right now, Peter. And that's true. In that context, in the first century, this word Messiah was loaded up with meaning. They had a very specific concept of what this Messiah would be. In fact, let me read. This is an inscription from the actual time that Jesus walked the earth. This is crazy, okay? I'm going to read this. The most divine, we should consider him equal to the beginning of all things. For when everything was falling into disorder, he restored it once more. He gave the whole world a new aura, the common good fortune of all, the beginning of life and vitality. All the cities unanimously adopt the birthday of the divine as the new beginning of the year. He's brought our life to the climax of perfection, being sent to us and our descendants as Savior, Messiah, having become God himself manifest among us. They didn't write that about Jesus. They wrote that about Caesar. They're talking about Caesar. Caesar is their Messiah. They think Caesar is divine. They think he's God manifest, God incarnate with them. Caesar is the light of the world. Caesar is divine. They think he's God manifest, God incarnate with them. Caesar is the light of the world. Caesar is the prince of peace. He's the one who brought the peace of Rome, right? The Pax Romana. They worship Caesar. They think he's God. And so when the Jewish people are expecting a Messiah of their own to come, they're expecting their Jewish version of Caesar, like somebody who's going to take over, somebody who's going to rule the government, maybe a military leader or a political leader, somebody who's gonna take over, and they're going to rule and reign alongside him. Peter is probably thinking, dude, only weeks ago, months ago, I don't know the timeframe, but not long ago, I was just a fisherman. I mean, I'd been kicked out of rabbi school, I was just a fisherman fisherman and now i'm the right hand man to the most powerful rabbi on the planet i'm going to sit at his right hand and i'm going to have power and position peter is taking this real jesus that stands in front of him and he's fitting him into a small box of his understanding this is what i understand the messiah to look like and i'm going to take jesus and i'm going to fit him into that box when we do, we lose part of the real Jesus. There's some truth that we fit into that box, but we lose some of the real Jesus. We all do it. We all get sort of sidetracked with our own agenda, our own worldview, and we fit the parts of Jesus that are most palatable to us, the ones that make the most sense to us. We get rid of the confusing stuff, we get rid of the challenging stuff, and we just pick the stuff we want. Like I want the love, I want the grace, the acceptance. Like give me all the uplifting stuff. It's not build a bear. I don't get to just like choose what I want. We try to construct for ourselves a Jesus that's easy to follow, but the truth is there's a Jesus that's easy to follow, and then there's the real Jesus. They're not the same. We all are guilty of this. And this is where I really want you to lean in and remember that this message is for you, not just for somebody else. We all have a tendency to build up these Jesuses, I'm gonna call them halfway Jesus. It's like it's part of Jesus that's true, but we leave out some other parts. For some of us, it's very easy to do this in the United States, a cultural Jesus. You know, like some of Christian values have sort of been a part of our culture. You know, it's been with the stream of our culture to just say you're a Christian. Maybe your family heritage is, well, we always went to church. I don't know, we've always just sort of been Christians. It's easy to go along with the cultural current and be a cultural Christian. Ryan said earlier, we've got a team on the other side of the world right now. We sent them there. I can't tell you where they're at because if I do, it might bring some heat on the church there and they might get further persecuted. We can't tell you where they're at. People over there get persecuted for their faith. They get killed for their faith. They don't have halfway cultural Jesus over there. It's just all in Jesus over there. But it's easy for us to have a cultural version, not a version that we have a vital personal relationship with but just like sort of the check the box Jesus, you know? We have get out of hell card Jesus. So it's like, I need the part of Jesus that makes sure that I get into heaven someday. The daily relationship part, I don't really want that. I want, what's the bare minimum I can do and still get in? It's sort of like a kid who asks his parent, and still get in. It's sort of like a kid who asks his parent, like how much do I have to love you and how much do I need to be around you to make sure that I still get the inheritance someday, that I'm still not, I don't wanna be written out of the will. So what do I gotta do? What's the bare minimum I gotta do? Some of us use like emergency contact Jesus. I need the Jesus that will be the safety net for me. I in case of emergency, but he's not my daily, I'm not daily dependent on him kind of Jesus. I need the safety net part. Some of us have a compartmentalized Jesus. It's sort of like a, I worship him on Sundays. I'm cool to come to church on Sundays. I'll raise my hands. I'll even sing the songs. I'll try to pay attention to the message. I'll give you Sunday, Sunday morning. I'm not gonna give you Sunday afternoon but Sunday morning and then Monday through Saturday, Jesus doesn't really penetrate my work life, my personal life. Jesus really isn't in every area of my life, but I'll give him part of my week. He's somewhat important. Some of us need like an inspirational Jesus. He's an inspirational quote machine. He's like Hobby Lobby Jesus. He's like a scripture verse that's sewn on a throw pillow and you put it in your living room, or it's a daily devotional that you read. There's nothing wrong with it, but it's a daily devotional that's primarily geared to help you get through your day. I need to get what I can get out of Jesus so that I can have a good life. I need inspirational quote Jesus. We get all the inspirational stuff, we don't really get the challenge stuff, the conviction stuff. Similarly, there's like a Jesus that's sort of just my buddy. He's like homeboy Jesus. Do you remember those shirts, those Jesus is my homeboy shirts? You remember those? Those are like 20 years old now. I'm old now. But I used to think those were really cool. And then in hindsight, I'm like, I don't know, man. Homeboy Jesus is sort of like, he's just chill. He accepts me for me We just hang out. I read the Bible. I don't see, Jesus is the least chill person I've ever read about. There's nothing chill about him at all. And he does. Do you get grace from him? Yes. Does he accept you right where you are? Yes. But when we just have homeboy Jesus, we sort of forget. No, but there's a call to righteousness. Jesus is holy. He challenges us to be conformed to his image. We lose something when we only have a part of him. This last one is sort of personal for me. I'll call him like, bless me, Jesus. It's like when your prayers mainly are about, God, can you do this in my life? Can you help this person? Can you do these things? And it ends up being very circumstantial. If your circumstances are good, you tend to feel like, yeah, and God is good. He's the good God who answers my prayers. And when your circumstances fall apart, you start to feel like, where is God? This isn't fair. I'm entitled to better things than this. And I would, listen, I would have sat in the crowd years ago and I would have said, hey, this is a great message for somebody else, but I follow the real Jesus. I hope there's some people in the room that are hearing but I follow the real Jesus. And then three years ago, my wife was diagnosed with MS. And I mean, guys, I stood on the stage. You've seen me. I've stood on the stage and led worship and prayed so many times that, God, we root our hope on you, the unchanging God, the solid rock that we can build a foundation on because our circumstances are shaky. But when our circumstances are shaky, you never are. When our circumstances are a mess, you're the Prince of Peace. Like I've said that so many times. And then when my circumstances got turned upside down, I was shocked at how much of my confidence was really rooted in my life is going pretty good, not in this Jesus that I said is a firm foundation for me to build my life on. It was eyeopening. This message is for everybody. We all have this tendency to build my life on, it was eye opening. This message is for everybody. We all have this tendency to build up a halfway version. Parts of it are true, but it's an incomplete picture. It leads us to sort of a self-serving relationship with Jesus, it leads us to complacency, in some cases a false sense of security about my relationship with Jesus. It leads us to ultimately to a gospel that's no gospel at all. It's a halfway gospel and so it's no gospel at all. A halfway Jesus is no Jesus at all. A halfway Jesus is dangerous. He can comfort, you build him up all you want. He can comfort you, but he can't heal you. He sounds good, but he can't save you. Halfway Jesus is dangerous and that's why I think that Jesus, right after Peter says, okay, you're the Messiah, I think Jesus feels like I need to set the record straight a little bit. Let me be clear that I'm not the kind of Messiah that overthrows the government and gives you the power that you crave. Instead, Jesus begins to turn back to the crowds. He had been away with his disciples. Now he turns back to the crowds, and he starts to teach. He says, if any of you wants to be my follower, you must give up your own way. Take up your cross daily and follow me. If you try to hang on to your life, you'll lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you'll save it. Halfway Jesus is all about us getting our own way. We build a Jesus that's easy to follow, that fits our mold and gives us what we want. Halfway Jesus gives us our own way. The real Jesus says, you gotta give up your own way. That's difficult. Raise your hand if you're really good at giving up your own way. You don't want control, you don't, of course not. We want our own way. And the people hear this and they're starting to, I wonder if they're just feeling like, I don't know, tell me more. But this doesn't feel like the Messiah that I was trying to follow. And Jesus says, take up your cross and follow me. Listen, they might've had some misunderstandings about what the word Messiah meant, but I promise you, they knew about the cross. They knew what a Roman cross looked like. They knew that it was a terrifying, excruciating instrument of death. They had seen people nailed to it. This isn't a halfway invitation that Jesus is giving. This is an all the way invitation. And consequently, the crowd's thin. People don't wanna follow a Jesus like that. I was here for the miracles, Jesus. I was here for the good things you could do in my life. This doesn't sound like the messiah i was looking for hashtag not my messiah this is not they disappear and the closer jesus gets to the cross the more people disappear to the to the extent that when he's nailed to the cross his inner circle is nowhere to be found peter himself who just declared jesus is the messiah you're the lord you're the christ you're the savior he bolts he denies jesus three times and disappears everybody the crowds flocked to him that were buzzing about his miracles have now dissipated because they don't want any of this sacrifice that comes with following the real Messiah. They're basically saying what we all know at a gut level is true. Halfway Jesus is not worth dying for. He's calling me to come and die, to follow him even up until death. And a halfway Jesus is not worth dying for they're saying this this right here you must give up your own way and take up your cross and follow me this doesn't make any sense with the picture of the messiah that i have i'm not going to die for just anything think about the short list of things that you're willing to die for. I don't die for halfway Jesus, but what if? What if he really is? Like, what if he really is who the scriptures say he is? What if he is the Messiah? What if he's the Savior? What if he's the one that died on the cross in your place? What if he's the only way to be made right before God to have your sins atoned for? What if he's the only way to heaven what if he's the only path forward then if he really is this then i might actually dare to do this i may give up my life if he really is who he says he is and i'm telling you the more i pursue jesus the more i believe that he is the real deal the more i know about him the more compelling he is. The more I surrender my life to him, it doesn't make it easy, but it makes it better. The more I pursue Jesus, the more I'm compelled by who he is in the gospel. Guys, he saved my marriage. He took a dead marriage and he made it alive again. He brings peace into circumstances that are not peaceful in any way. I've got some circumstances in my life that I'm still praying for a miracle about, and I'm still scared and have little waves of anxiety over, but God in the midst of that will still give me some level of peace that doesn't match up even with my circumstances. Peace that I don't quite understand. He's shown me a new way to live. It produces love in live. It produces love in me. It produces joy and compassion in me, care for people that I otherwise would have trouble caring for. It impacts people around. The way that he's changing me is impacting other people. He's given me satisfaction in Christ that I can't find in the world. The ways that I've tried to have my thirst quenched by the world, he's shown me satisfaction that's better. The more I pursue Jesus, the more I'm convinced that he's the real deal, the more I want to stand on a stage like this and shout as loud as I can to anyone who will listen, you've got to drop the things you're holding on to and run to Jesus. He's better. Relinquish the things you're holding so tight to and run to him. He's worth more. And it's still hard. Nobody wants to release their grip and surrender. It goes against our natural instincts. I think Jesus knows that, that our natural instinct is bent towards selfishness, bent toward control, not wanting to surrender, but instead to have independence that I would control. I'd be the master of my own destiny. Jesus knows that about you. He's not surprised by that. I think he actually has the surprised by that. I think he actually has the solution to it. I think he sort of built it right into the call to follow him. The solution to our bent away from Jesus is this frequency with which we recommit our lives to him. It's daily. It's not a one-time sensational declaration that, well, I said he was Jesus one time. I said he was the Savior. I prayed a prayer once when i was 12 it's not that it's not just a sensational declaration it's a daily recommitment is a daily relationship and walk with him that way i can't stray too far he knows i'm prone to wander off if i recommit myself to him daily i can only wander so far i can wander about 24 hours in the wrong direction. And then you know what? Jesus faithfully, lovingly allows me to turn back to him and say, geez, I messed up everything yesterday. I mean, I didn't show compassion. I chose my own. I knew I was, I knew the Holy Spirit was telling me to do this. I chose my own way instead. I gave into this sin pattern that I'm just like fighting so hard to beat. I can come back to Jesus and say, I messed it all up, and he graciously, mercifully says, that's okay, maybe not that's okay, but let's walk together. Jump back on the path with me and let's walk together. If I recommit myself to him daily, I can't stray too far. And that's what it takes, it takes daily dependence. It's the kind of relationship Jesus wants. It really is, we sometimes around here, we say progress, not perfection, or pursuit, not perfection. It's not a perfect relationship, but it is this gradual progress, these steps forward, this pursuit of Jesus that happens daily. It's what it takes to know anybody, is pursuing them regularly. Like my wife and I, we're coming up on 17 years of marriage. Not quite there, but 17 years of marriage. And you better believe, I know her so much more now than I did on day one, right, in year one. Because we spend every day with one another. We don't take days off. We see the good and the bad, we see the weird and the gross, like married people know. Watch your spouse brush their teeth, and that's really more, I'm gross, but I get toothpaste all over my beard. I don't know why she's still with me. But we see the real, we see the unsanitized, real version of one another. We don't see the, I don't see the halfway Jenna. She doesn't see the halfway Matt. We see the real versions of one another. And consequently, we know each other so much better. It's the relationship that we need with the Lord. We need to know him. We need a right answer to the question, who do you say I am? Knowing him is this daily process. And I've agonized over, okay, God, what am I supposed to do standing on a stage and telling people that they need to know you? What can I give them to do? How can I give them a five-step breakdown of how to know you? And we do that sometimes at Fearless. We do it, man, Chris Williams is a master at giving you practical steps to put into action the next week, and I've tried to think of some, and there's nothing wrong with these. You could totally try not listening to music in your car, but instead listen to the audio Bible. Or for me, this was convicting, I thought, man, when I wake up, the first thing I do when my phone alarm goes off, I either like clear my email or check the news or check the sports scores from the night before. I could read scripture first. I could let God be the first voice in my life. Like there are things, habits that you could develop that would help prioritize God in your life daily, I guess I'm gonna trust you to come up with some of those habits and put them into action in your life. The thing that I'm scared about doing is, if I just give you habits, I wonder if two weeks from now, three weeks from now, eventually that habit will not be as meaningful, it will sort of fade away like every other New Year's resolution. It's perfect timing, we're in late February, we're about to be moving toward late February, we're about to be, you know, moving toward late February, statistically, 80, 90% of your New Year's resolutions are long gone. You've already given up on them. And that's not, whatever. If my New Year's resolution was to get in shape and I don't do it, I, you know, I stuck with it for two weeks and then I gave up on it, then I've got a dad bod at spring break. And it's not like, is that, that's not the end of the world. It's not the end of the world But if we try to build habits in our lives That pursue Jesus daily And we're like, I don't know, it just didn't stick That's a big deal There's too much at stake I don't want it to just be like reduced down To some simple habits Habits are fine, but what you really ought to do And I don't know what this looks like for each person You should spend real time Considering your answer to the question, who do you say I am? With sober judgment, like with humility, consider the answer to that question. Not just saying like I would have years ago, like I'm sure I follow, I follow the real Jesus. Let the Holy Spirit begin to root out some of these things where you've put God in this box and you limit him, you forget some parts of him that are real, you're following a halfway Jesus, a 75% Jesus, anything that's not the whole Jesus is not what I want, I want all. I wanna be all in. You owe it to yourself to take time, put a reminder in your phone before you leave today, put it on your to-do list, whatever it takes, but take time and really consider this. Consider the answer to your question. Pray about it like your life depends on it because in some ways it very much does. There will come a time for absolutely everybody in this room where we will breathe our last breath here on earth and we will see Jesus face to face. And we will not see halfway Jesus. When you stand before him, it won't be the Jesus you've constructed. It won't be halfway Jesus. We will see the real Jesus. When you stand before him, it won't be the Jesus you've constructed. It won't be halfway Jesus. We will see the real Jesus. And I want it so badly for me. And I want it so badly for you that when we get there, when we take our ticket and we finally get up to the front counter and Jesus is there, that he says, I know you. And I can say, I know you too, Jesus. I know you. That's what I want. I want it for me, I want it for you. It is the absolute most important decision you can ever make. And I think for so many of us in the room, any of us in the room that call ourselves Jesus followers right now, today is a day to recommit. That's not because I know your circumstances, I know where you're at, and I know you need to recommit, you need to recommit. No, I just think we're supposed to recommit daily, and today's a new day. So I think everybody in this room who's a Jesus follower can maybe pray along with me in a moment. We're gonna pray a prayer of commitment. I think today's a day that you should recommit, and the good news for you, no matter how far you've sort of strayed and gone your own path for a day or for a week, for a month, for however long, scripture also says that his mercies for you are new every day. Commit to him every day and his mercies for you are new every day. It means when you turn to him and you say, Jesus, I'm sorry, I haven't put you first. I've said that you're Lord of my life, but I'm in charge of my life. I haven't put you in charge of my life. I'm sorry. I've messed up so much. I've run so far away. Jesus mercifully accepts you back. He doesn't judgmentally accept you back. He doesn't passive aggressively, you know, throw some jabs at you on your way back. He mercifully accepts you and says, let's walk down the path. Follow me. Follow me. Every one of us can pray that prayer today. And there's another group of people in the room that I don't wanna neglect. In fact, I've been praying for you like crazy. As Fearless Church has grown, we know that there are a lot of people that are back in church for the first time in a long time. And there are people who have found this to be a safe place. We say it all the time, a safe place to explore matters of faith. There are people in the room that have been curious about Jesus. They're trying to sort it out. You started to feel the nudge from the Holy Spirit. You started starting to feel like, man, I think God is sort of calling me. I think this Jesus, I don't know everything about him. I sure could know more about the Bible. I'm not a scripture expert, but I'm starting to think that this Jesus is who he says he is. I think he's the real deal. There are people in the room, you've been feeling that tug and maybe even feeling like, I think I'm ready to make a commitment to follow Jesus, but I just don't know exactly how, or maybe God, give me a sign. If you're waiting for a sign, consider this your sign. We're gonna pray a prayer of commitment, and you could pray that prayer for the first time today, and it would absolutely be the best decision you've ever made. It would change the trajectory of your life. It would impact every relationship and change how you make every decision. It will inform your entire life here and it will determine your experience of the life to come. I can't wait for some people to make that decision. Been praying like crazy about it. So what I'm gonna ask you to do is bow your head and close your eyes. Honor system, I know how this works, don't look around. And we're all gonna pray in just a moment. But if you are somebody that God has been pulling on, he's been pulling on your heart, and you say, I think I'm ready. I do want to commit to him. I wanna make a real commitment to follow Jesus today. I'm just gonna ask, would you be brave and just raise your hand? That's so good. Thank you. Okay, let's pray. Thank you, Jesus. Jesus, I believe that you are the son of God. I believe that you are Messiah. You're the savior. And I wanna keep getting to know you more, but I believe that this much is true, that you died on the cross to rescue me from my sin. You paid the penalty so I don't have to die the way I would have otherwise. I don't have to pay for the penalty of my sins. You died in my place. You make a way for me to be with you forever. you make a way for me to be with you forever. And God, I choose now to turn from my sins, from my self-centeredness in every part of my life that doesn't please you, that's not in line with you, that's not walking with you. God, today I choose you. I choose the real you, not a halfway version of you. God, today I receive your forgiveness. I ask for you to take your rightful place in my life as Savior and as Lord. You are not somewhat important. You are of the utmost importance. Help me, God, to follow you daily. Change my heart to be more like yours, I pray. Thank you. Thank you, we pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Amen"}]}

I would tell you, if you are a lady who has not signed up yet, please pull out your phone right now, go to our website, go to the events page, sign up right away. Or if you know a woman who has not yet signed up, so it's maybe your girlfriend, wife, mom, sister, friend, whatever it is, pull out your phone, text them right now, and let them know that tonight is at midnight, registration closes. And we want to make sure that anyone who wants to go has an opportunity to go. This is a great training event. If you want to connect with God or you want to connect with other ladies. In fact, I shared this in the first service. And what I'm excited about as I look at our registrations is there's dozens of ladies that are there that don't know anyone in our church. So you might be sitting here thinking, man, I don't know anybody. Why would I go somewhere? I don't, it's a great way to meet people and get connected. And then yesterday I got an email and this lady shared and she said, you know what? I've been hurt by church. So I'm not interested in going to church at all, but I want to grow and connect to God through Jesus Christ. I want to move towards Jesus Christ. So can I go to Fearless Woman Camp? And we told her, no. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. We said, yes, that's awesome. So you may be in that category. You may be like, man, church is not my thing, but I am curious about Jesus. What would it look like to walk with Christ? So I would encourage you again, if you're a lady or you know a lady who has not signed up, please, because tonight we need to close it so that we can make appropriate plans with the camp and all kinds of things to make it a great event. So why do we do training events like this? In fact, I tell people, if Sunday morning is all you come to, you're really missing out on what I would consider the best part of Fearless Church. We do a lot of things outside of this one hour, 10 minute experience on a Sunday morning that I really do think can be a blessing to you and your family. They can challenge you. If you're searching, it can help you in your search for who God is and how to have a relationship with him. Or if you do have a relationship with Jesus and you wanna grow, we have a lot of training events and environments. And the reason that we do these things is to fulfill our mission. Our mission is our why. Why do we exist as a church? Here's how we say it. We want to be fearless followers of Jesus who change the world. And our goal is to train in pursuit of that mission, in pursuit of the vision that God's given us. Our vision, what we believe God has called us to do as a church, is to initiate a mighty multiplication movement of God, where individually we contribute to the movement of God as we become faithful followers. The Bible uses the word disciples who help other people follow. Disciples who make disciples. And as we work together to send people out in teams around Dayton, around the state of Ohio, around the U.S., around the world to go help start other churches in different ways, different styles, whatever, to connect with different people, to be able to be part of the movement that God has called us to be. And one thing we've done recently, and this is really, if you're a guest of ours or haven't been here in a few weeks, I would share with you this. This fall, what we're doing is we are training by studying the mighty multiplication movement of God according to the book of Acts. Now, if you were to open up your Bible, you're going to find two major sections. You'll find something called the Old Testament, and there's 39 historical documents that make up the Old Testament. This is everything before Jesus. So from the very beginning of the earth all the way to the nation Israel, all kinds of amazing history and prophecy, awesome things in that. And then you have the New Testament. There's 27 historical documents that make up the New Testament. That tells us about who Jesus is, the gospels. You may have heard this before, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, giving us four different perspectives on the life, the teachings, the death, the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And then you have the rest of the New Testament, 23 documents, including the book of Acts, which tells us about what happened right after Jesus ascended into heaven. And so we've been studying the movement of the church, the movement of the Holy Spirit of God in the church and through the church, according to the book of Acts, in a series entitled The Movement. And today is part two. Last week, we looked at and began to discuss the first day of the mighty movement of God. In fact, there were about 120 believers that had gathered in the upper room and they were praying. They were celebrating the day of Pentecost, the Jewish festival. And all of a sudden, a mighty rushing wind filled the room, shocked everybody there. And if that wasn't the weirdest part, all of a sudden flames of fire came in, looked like tongues of fire, divided and came over each one of their heads. And they're like, this is crazy. And then Luke tells us they were filled with the Holy Spirit. And we knew they were filled with the Holy Spirit because all of a sudden they begin to say things in a language they didn't already know. A language some of them had never even heard of. And the things that they were saying were the wonderful things that God had been doing. Specifically things that God had been doing through his son, Jesus. They told about Jesus' teachings, his miracles, his death, and even his resurrection. Well, that day, there had been a lot of people from multiple nations in Jerusalem to celebrate both Passover and that day, Pentecost. And they hear this mighty rushing wind, and they come booking towards where they were all at. And they're like, man, what is going on? And they show up. And all of a sudden, all these people from multiple nations begin to hear the good news, the story of Jesus in their own language. All of a sudden, they felt part of something that at times in their life, they had felt distant. What could God be doing? Someone asked the question, man, what is God doing? Other people came to the conclusion, oh man, these people were just drunk. And in that setting, Peter actually steps up and he tells them, listen up, all of you, I'm going to explain what's happening. He continues on. He says, these people are not drunk. How did Peter know they weren't drunk? He said, because they're Southern Baptists. Now, if you don't get that joke, it's because you're cool. The rest of us grew up in church. I grew up Southern Baptist. So if I just offended you, we can go out for a beer. No, we can't. But we, see, here's the funny thing. Southern Baptists are not allowed to tell people when they drink. That's the way it goes. So anyway, he didn't say that. It's not much of a better answer. He says, no, it's only nine o'clock. You know, nobody's lit at that time. All right, but I guess he's saying, basically there's not enough hours in the day right now for them to be drunk. Now what you're seeing, this rushing wind, this people speaking in languages they didn't already know what you what you're seeing this was predicted long ago hundreds of years before there was a prophet by the name of joel again joel is one of those historical documents if you want to look up and read some of the prophecies that he made some of the truths and some of the foretelling of what would happen you can read them in joel chapter 2 i'm going to read just a couple of them that Peter quotes from. He quotes from Joel, and he says this, in the last days, God says, I'm going to pour out my spirit upon all people. Your sons and daughters, they'll prophesy. Your young men will see visions, and even your old men will dream dreams. Now, this was a significant moment for them, because throughout the Old Testament, keep in mind, they didn't have Old Testament documents. They were living in the Old Testament. And what they experienced was that God would speak to them through prophecy, through visions and dreams. In fact, if you want to see some of this, you can read in the Old Testament, certain prophecies, certain visions that they had and certain dreams. But if you think about them for their nation, they had only heard about these things. And it would only happen a few times for a few people. And again, what that caused is this feeling of disconnect. Man, God's revealed himself, but it's only a few times over a few people. And Peter's saying, all that's changing today. Joel promised it would change, that God desires to communicate clearly to all people. In fact, he's going to put his spirit in all people so they can have the revelation and the understanding of who God is. It doesn't matter if they're men or women. It doesn't matter if they're young or old. It doesn't matter their lot in society. If people say, oh, they're just servants, they're not important. All people are going to be able to hear the voice of God through the Holy Spirit, and all people have access to salvation. Everyone, doesn't matter who they are, where they've been, what they've done, everyone can experience salvation now, and everyone can experience the Holy Spirit in their life. And then Peter starts to preach. And like any good preacher, he says, listen up, everybody listen up. He addresses his audience specifically, the nation of Israel, all the Israeli people, listen up, God's people. And he said, now God has publicly endorsed, or let's say verified, the identity of who Jesus is, this Jesus the Nazarene. Who is he? Is he really God's son? And so Peter's going to present this argument that yes, he is. And so he begins by saying he endorsed him by doing powerful miracles and wonders and signs through him as you will know as you have seen as you have heard now Jesus did some miraculous things some of you are familiar you could tell a few of the stories there were blind people that received their sight there were lame people were able to walk he even raised up people from the dead i mean he did some miraculous wondrous signs and he did those things because he loved people but the primary reason was to show people who he was jesus wanted people to know i'm not just some typical rabbi i i am the son of god i am emmanuel. I am God with you. In fact, Jesus said himself, he said, you don't have to believe me unless something I do shows you, unless I carry out the work of my father's work. But if I do the work, believe in the evidence of the miraculous works I have done. Even if you're in this category and you say you don't believe, you're gonna know and you're gonna understand that the father is in me and I am in the Father based on these works. In other words, you're going to understand that I'm God by observing and seeing these miraculous things. In fact, I would say today in 2023, the reason we have Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, I think because God wants you and I to know that he sent Jesus, not just as a prophet, not just as an amazing teacher, but as his one and only son, God in the flesh. The miracles verified who Jesus was and who Jesus is. And so Peter continues. He says, look, the miracles prove it, but let's go one step farther. And he says, God knew what would happen. In fact, it was part of his prearranged plan that he carried out when Jesus was betrayed. Some of you remember that story, right? Judas kissed him on the cheek betrayed him he goes to trial and he says with the help of lawless gentiles you nailed him to the cross and you ultimately killed him so peter's point is look what happened to jesus his arrest his trial his execution was all part of the plan god didn't just know it would happen he was orchestrating it in fact luke records for us in acts chapter 4 beautiful prayer a prayer of great faith and peter is talking to god the father listen what peter says he says herod and tippus he lists names pontius pilate the governor the gentiles and the people of israel they were all united against jesus your holy servant whom you anointed it's almost like he's praying to god you anointed him you appointed him to go to the cross and watch what he says the next thing he says he says everything they did and if you know if some of you that have grown up in church you know some of the things pontius pilate did some of the things herod did i mean these were illegal things they they they misconstrued some information so that jesus would be arrested and on trial and did some things so he could be executed in a time he shouldn't have been executed. And all of it was determined according to what? God's will. Peter's point is, look, Jesus' death was all part of God's plan. And he continues on, and he says, it's not just that. He says, but God released him. Jesus didn't stay dead. He released him from the horrors of death. He raised him back to life. For death could not keep him in its grips. So Peter begins his message. And he says, listen, this Jesus, this Jesus, let me tell you the facts I know. This Jesus came and did miracles that proved he is God's son. This Jesus, he died according to God's plan. And this Jesus rose from the grave. Now, like any good pastor in that moment he knows and he recognizes his audience his audience may hear that and they're like okay okay we've maybe heard that before maybe we believe it maybe we don't but he grabs their attention grabs their hearts on a level that they would trust and understand and that level was through king david king david was a beloved and trusted King in the nation Israel so he goes right there where they already agreed he said let me tell you something King David he was talking about Jesus hundreds of years before he starts to quote he says look when you read in Psalm 16 you're reading David talking about Jesus I'm gonna read you a couple experts he says excerpts excuse, I see the Lord, and Peter would argue that Lord right there is Jesus. He's always with me. Why? Because Jesus is eternal. He says, I will not be shaken for he's right beside me. And then check this out. He says, for you will not leave my soul among the dead or allow your holy one to rot in the grave. So when you read that you have to ask okay who is david talking about is he talking about himself because he says my soul and he was king david is he the holy one and and peter would say no he's he's not talking about himself he'd say david wasn't talking about himself and we know he wasn't talking about himself because he did die and he was buried in his tomb still among us it's okay then in psalm 16 who's david talking about he says look david's speaking as a prophet in that moment when he was writing psalm 16 he's reading as a prophet that he knew god promised with him an oath you can read that oath you can read that promise in second samuel chapter 7 verse 12 god promises what that one of david's own descendants would sit on the throne. So David is making a prophecy or prediction based on a promise he believed. So Peter would say, okay, if you really want to understand what David's talking about in Psalm 16, he would say, David is looking into the future and speaking of the Messiah's resurrection, not his own. He said he was saying that God would not leave him. Talking about Jesus, not David, because remember, David's tomb is still among us. And he says, I'm not going to leave you among the dead. And his body, talking about the body of Jesus, to rot in the grave. He said, this was what David was talking about. And he said, today, today, you need to understand this. And Peter testifies, this is the reality. This promise made by David so many years before has been fulfilled because indeed God has raised this Jesus from the dead. Well, how do you know, Peter? Because I witnessed it. I saw the guy down on the cross, and I'm telling you, he rose up. I talked with him. I ate breakfast with him. And I want you to remember a couple of weeks back, we looked, and Jesus promised this exact moment would happen. He said, y'all stay in Jerusalem, because the Holy Spirit's going to come down. And when the Holy Spirit comes down on you, you're going to be my witnesses. You're going to tell people what you saw, what you heard, what you experienced. You're going to testify. You know, the reason that we believe, the reason we believe that God raised Jesus from the dead is not simply because the Bible has some verses that says that. No, we believe that because there are historical documents that have been protected over time, written, that testify to what was said and what was done. We believe in the resurrection because James told us it happened. John told us it because james told us it happened john told it to happen peter told us it happened they witnessed and spoke of and thank god they even wrote about it so that we could see it this day so so peter continues on he says let me explain what's happening again he's talking to everybody that experienced pentecost he's let me explain what's happening god has now exalted jesus so jesus exalted. Think about that as the ascension. He's exalted. And where is Jesus? This is his ascension, and here is his location. His ascension and his location. Jesus is no longer with us. He is now at the right hand of God. He continues on. He says, and the Father, as he had promised, gave him, talking about Jesus, the Holy Spirit to pour on us, just as you see and you hear today. You're observing this promise in place, he's telling the people. So think about what he's saying. Jesus was with us. What an amazing thing. God walked with us, and that's no longer the case. So now he has ascended, and he's at the right hand of the Father, but now the Holy Spirit is in us. He has ascended and he's at the right hand of the Father. But now the Holy Spirit is in us. Before God was with us, now God is in us. This is a big moment. He goes back to something they would trust, David. And he says, look, David himself never, he's a great king. He's beloved, he's trusted. He's King David. He represents a part of the promise of God to us as a people. And he says, he never ascended to heaven, yet he said, and this is in Psalm 110, the Lord said to my Lord, good way to read this is like, God the Father said to God the Son, what did he say? He said, sit down in the place of my right hand until I humble your enemies, making them a footstool under your feet. This is the ultimate position of authority. God the father said to god the son you are now king of kings lord of lords you are all powerful everything is underneath your authority and your control even the people who deny who you are your enemies one day they will be humbled and have to acknowledge who you are you You have the authority to judge Jesus, judge who is righteous and not based on how they relate to you. You have the authority to judge and actually bring condemnation, eternal condemnation, send people to hell based on them rejecting you. One day, one day, even your enemies will have to acknowledge that you indeed are Lord of all. In fact, the apostle Paul, he talked about this. He said, God elevated him to the place of highest authority, the ascension of Christ, putting him at the right hand of God the Father. And he gave him a name above all other names, that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow. Where? Everywhere. In heaven, on earth, under the earth, regardless of where you are. And every tongue will confess one day, what? That Jesus is Lord to the glory of God, the father. One day, everybody, everybody will be forced to say he is Lord. And we are in a moment where we have to decide, do I say that now? Or do I say that after condemnation, after eternal separation from God, when I no longer can connect to God, After eternal separation from God, when I no longer can connect to God, will it be when I realize eternal punishment and separation in hell that he is indeed God? And Peter wraps up his message powerfully. He comes back and he says, look, people in Israel recognize this, that God has made this Jesus, the Nazarene, whom whom you crucified he's made him to be both lord and messiah he's made him to be messiah anointed one savior the one who would rescue your life and rule your life but he has made him to be what both not just one or the other. I think for me, so many times, I love the idea of Jesus dying on the cross for my sin and saving me from eternal judgment and punishment. I love that idea. Jesus, be my savior. But do I like the idea of him being my ruler, my boss, telling me how I like to live, I have to live my life. He says, just know he's made this Jesus to be both Lord and Messiah. And in that moment, the people had to decide, how do we respond to what Peter said? They had to decide their response because God's movement requires our response. God's movement requires our response. What God did on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit coming down upon these people and them speaking, we have to respond to that. What do we think about that? What God did speaking through Peter, proclaiming the good news of the gospel, calling people out and saying, you crucified him. God's made him Messiah. God's made him Lord. God's made him Savior. God's made him ruler. We have to respond. God's made him Lord. God's made him Savior. God's made him ruler. We have to respond. We have to ultimately respond to the life, the death, and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. So watch how they responded. Peter's words pierced their hearts. You ever had that moment? I don't know where you are in your spiritual journey, but I know dozens of you, if not hundreds, have this, where there was a time you were praying, maybe a time you were reading the Bible, maybe a time you were in a small group, maybe you were in a time in a setting like this and somebody's talking and your mind starts racing. Your heart starts racing. Something's happening and I would tell you what's happening in that moment is the Holy Spirit of God is trying to speak to you. The Holy Spirit of God is drawing you into a legitimate relationship where Jesus becomes your Savior and your Lord. And in that moment, you have to decide, what am I going to do? And for me, oftentimes what I do, I try to distract myself. Man, I don't want to hear that. I got to create some noise. But they, that day, that day, when God was stirring in their hearts, they didn't ignore it. They didn't push it aside and say, maybe next week. Instead, in that moment, they responded because God's movement requires what? Our response. And what did they say? They said, hey, what do we do? What do we do to get right with God? Clearly, we have this elaborate religious system. You can read all about it in the Old Testament. It's awesome. All kinds of sacrifice, symbolic stuff. It's amazing. We have all these rules and these regulations, but you're telling us, you're telling us now Jesus has changed all that. What do we do? I would argue today, this is the most important question of our lives. What do we do? How do we get right with God? And I want you to know, if you've come to the conclusion you're solid you're watching online you're solid with your man God ain't real dude there is no God if that's you then I would say you don't have to do anything live however you want and hope I don't know why you would pray but maybe you pray that everything Peter said on that day was a lie but just know this. Know this. To live apart from God is to be an enemy of God. And to be an enemy of God, what did God say? I'm going to put your enemies, Jesus, where? Under your feet. You're not eternally beside Jesus. You're eternally separated from Jesus. But if you're in the category of, man, I guess I believe in some kind of spirituality. I don't know what it is. Your friend invited you to watch online or be in this room today, and you're like, I believe in some kind of higher power. I'm not sure. I believe in some kind of afterlife. You owe it to yourself to ask and answer this question. What do we do? So Peter replies. He's going to answer their question. What do we do? So Peter replies. He's going to answer their question. What do you think he said? I know some of you know, but for those that don't know, what do you think he said? He said probably what you would assume he'd say, man. You've got to do good things and don't do bad things. Some people are laughing because they know that's not what he said. But listen, listen. bad things some people are laughing because they know that's not what he said but listen listen don't be ashamed of the reality that many of you many of you believe that I've never met a person and if you're in this category I'd love to meet you today I think it'd be fun to interact with you I've never had a person walk up to me and say hey hey Chris you know what I'm perfect like I've never done anything wrong in my entire life. You're looking at it, and it's awesome, right? Because I would probably mess up their hair and say, you're not perfect anymore. I don't know what I would do, right? That's my own issue. But you know what people do say? I'm not that bad. Like, like I mean I've never done right whatever that is we all have I've never done this and whatever this is is something that you're like now that that deserves like God's punishment that deserves help like I've never done that and and many of us in this room I'm telling you if I didn't have these conversations I wouldn't say it regularly would say my plan is to be good enough my plan is to do enough good things and avoid enough bad things that at the end, when I stand before God, there's some kind of eternal cosmic scale that it's going to be weighed out and ding, ding, ding, ding. You've done enough good. You're great. You're in. And I'm sorry if that's what you believe, if that's what you've been taught. That's what religion teaches, but that's not what the Bible teaches. That day, Peter stood in front of these people when they said, what should we do? And he said, each of you have to respond. You have to repent of your sins and turn to God. To repent just means changing directions. We have a way we live our life, a way we wake up tomorrow, and we make decisions based on this way. And he says, stop and turn and walk a new way. But notice what he says. It's not just avoid the bad stuff. That's not what brings about salvation. That's not what brings about relationship. He says, turn to God. Why turn to God? For the forgiveness of your sins. See, first and foremost, we have to recognize our need for God's forgiveness. And unless you know the reality that you and I are guilty of sin, sin is disobeying God. You're looking at a person that, this may sound prideful, but I think I'm an expert at sin. No one has ever had to teach me how to do it. Even though I don't want to do it, I still do it. I don't know what's wrong with me other than I'm a broken man, and I'm not the only one in this room. There's another person like me, and guess what? They're sitting in your chair we are guilty of sin so much so that the only way i'm going to be made right with god and you're going to be made with god is if god chooses to forgive us when we try to be good enough we're negating our need for the forgiveness of god's sin for our sin you catch that if i say i'm good enough then i don't need this but if you and i recognize that we're not good enough, then we desperately need His forgiveness that only He can offer, so we don't just turn away from sin, we turn to a Savior, we turn to one who can rescue and forgive us. So how do we access that forgiveness? Peter goes on, he says, you'll be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Now why does Peter link God's forgiveness with baptism? Well, the guy who wrote Acts was a guy by the name of Luke. He's one of the largest contributors to the New Testament. He wrote all the Gospel of Luke, which is the longest gospel. He wrote the book of Acts, one of the longest books in the New Testament, if not the longest word for word. And Luke records for us in his gospel, chapter three, a little bit about baptism. He says, John, and he's not talking about the apostle John. He's talking about John the Baptist. He would go from place to place. Now, this occurred before the ministry of Jesus. So at this point, Jesus was already alive, but he wasn't yet teaching and doing ministry, okay? So Jesus is probably around 30 years old at this point. And this guy named John the Baptist, who was actually a prophet of God, he's baptizing people on both sides of the Jordan all around and he's preaching. People need to be baptized. John, why do they need to be baptized? He says, to show that they've repented of their sins and turned to God to be forgiven. So you're like, okay, this matches up. Like we just read it in the book of Acts, and now we're reading it here. This particular statement occurred three and a half years before what Peter is preaching and proclaiming. And so he says, okay, this type of baptism was a ceremonial act of cleansing, a physical act where they would be dunked underneath water, representing the reality that they had repented and turned to God. that they had repented and turned to God. And now God, John is saying, now there is another baptism that is coming down the pipeline, another way that you are going to be cleansed, not just ceremonially, but physically and spiritually forevermore. There's a better baptism coming. In fact, John said it this way. He said, I baptize you with water, but someone is coming soon who is greater than I am. Someone's on the way. I'm not even worthy to untie his sandals. And he's going to bring a spiritual cleansing that will never end. A supernatural spiritual cleansing. And what is that? It is the cleansing of the baptism, the Holy Spirit. That's what he's gonna baptize you. John says this, John teaches this, three and a half years later. So in the context, Jesus is born, lives a sinless life, teaches like nobody else, did miraculous, amazing things. Jesus dies on the cross, resurrection, ascension, and now here we are, three and a half years later, and Peter is saying, if you turn to God, if you turn to God and you're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, then you, you will receive, you will receive the Holy Spirit. You will experience the baptism that Jesus comes to offer and bring to the scene. See, anytime someone is baptized, what's happening is they are declaring their desperate need for what? For the forgiveness of our sins. The forgiveness that is only offered by God through his son, Jesus Christ. That is what's happening. The apostle Paul would say it this way. He'd say, when we think about our spiritual lives, we've got to remember that we were dead. You're born, yes, physically alive, but you're born spiritually dead. How do we know this? Because of the sins you commit and they come straight from your nature. You don't have to teach someone how to sin. If you're a parent, you know that's right. Your cute little three-year-old girl can listen and say, yes, daddy, turn around and do the exact opposite of what you said. I've always been an expert as listening to people and placing things in authority over me hearing it understanding it and doing the opposite why because it's in my nature it's in your nature we were born that way spiritually dead but that all changed when what god made us alive together with christ how did god make us alive together he forgave our sins. Now, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second. This doesn't seem right, because when people disobey God and they sin against God, shouldn't a just God, a holy God punish sin? Like, allow your mind to go there for a moment. Many of you in this room, people have sinned against you. They have said things and done things that hurt. And your reaction, rightfully so, is, man, they need to pay for what they have done. They have sinned against me. Where is justice in that moment? And the apostle Paul would say, yes, yes, yes, yes. Every and all sin is going to be punished either by you will receive the punishment or someone else receives the punishment. Paul says, look, God's willing to cancel out the record of your charges. And all of us have a whole lot of charges. We have the stuff people know about. And then we have that file that no one knows about. The stuff you've said, done, thought, that one night, whatever it was, it's stuff, man, you're, you're so ashamed that you will never ever share with anybody. And God knows it. And he says, I'll cancel it. Not only will I cancel it, I'll forgive it. And not just forgive it, I'll punish it. I'll nail it to the cross. When Jesus went to the cross, he took that sin. He took that punishment. All sin is always punished. Either we receive that punishment or we trust Jesus to receive that punishment. So when someone is baptized in the name of Jesus, this is a very public act where they are acknowledging and a public act of allegiance. They acknowledge, I am spiritually dead and desperately in need of forgiveness from God. They are acknowledging, I'm not good enough. I will never be good enough. My sin deserves death and hell. But I acknowledge that Jesus died on the cross to pay the penalty of my sin. And today, today, I pledge my allegiance. I pledge my allegiance to Jesus as both my what? Savior and Lord. He is both the one who rescues me from my sin and he rules my life. And Peter would say, Peter would say, the only response to God's movement that's going to make you right with God, what shall we do? Remember, that's the question. What should we do? He would say, you must repent, turn to God, acknowledge, and pledge your allegiance to Jesus Christ as both your Lord and Savior, and you, you will be saved. You'll receive the Holy Spirit. You'll experience the baptism of Jesus, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, cleansing your life forevermore. The washing of regeneration is another Bible way to say it. And Peter says, here's really, really, really, really good news as he stands before all those people that day, he said, this promise, it's to you right now. It doesn't matter what language you speak. It doesn't matter what nation you came from. It doesn't matter what you've done. It's not only for you, but it is for the future. Your children, your children's children, this promise of salvation through Jesus Christ, it's actually to all those far off. In 2023, those who live in Dayton, Ohio, and beyond. He says, all people, all people have been called by the Lord our God. Not all people will respond. Some will not accept the invitation, but God desires that all people come to know his son, Jesus Christ. And he says, this promise, this promise to forever be forgiven is available to all people everywhere throughout generation to generation. And Luke records for us that then Peter continued preaching for a long time. Preachers got to preach, right? But this is my favorite part. Like, this is how you know, I think one of the reasons you know the Bible is true. He doesn't record the next two hours, right? He's like, let me sum up. He said, basically, he says, be safe from this crooked generation. In other words, same message, repent and turn to God. And then it happened. The people responded. God's movement requires our response. That day, they believed. The people responded. God's movement requires our response. That day, they believed. And then they acknowledged and pledged allegiance to Jesus Christ. They were added to the church, and then it began. Fearless church, listen. Then it began, the mighty multiplication movement of God. 3,000 people in one day. From 120 to 3,000 people in one day, from 120 to 3,000 people. One day, the Spirit of God comes down, empowers people to preach a amazing message. The people respond, and the movement begins. There is no movement of God apart from our response to God. Why? Because God's movement, it requires our response. So how do we respond? How do we respond? Like, we can't just listen to this and say, okay, Peter, thanks, great, awesome. We have to respond. Well, I think, first of all, we have to commit to listen carefully. What did Peter say at the beginning of his message? Listen carefully, and that may be right where you're at. Maybe you're like, dude, the stuff you're sharing, that's great. That's wonderful. I kind of understand it. I definitely don't agree with it. What if you said my response to the movement of God is to listen, to begin a season of searching out who God is. One of my favorite verses in the Bible is Jeremiah 29 verse 13. It says, if you seek God with all your heart, you will find him. What if for just a season today's october 1st what about october 1st to january 1st you do everything you can to find the answers to seek out and let me tell you what's going to happen as you search eventually you're going to get come up to this question what should i do how do i respond if everything the bible says is true is if this is real how should i respond and peter would say you've got to repent of your sin. You've got to turn, turn away from the way you're living. Here at Fearless Church, we like to say it this way. It's a commitment of pursuit, not perfection. It doesn't mean you're going to be perfect, but you're going to pursue. But it's pursuit, not pursuit away from. It's pursuit towards what? God. Oh, wait a second. I thought if I just stopped sinning or sin less, that would make me right. No, no, no, remember, you're not made right by what you do. You're made right by what he did. And you turn to God in desperation for forgiveness through his son, Jesus Christ. And you're baptized, not as a ceremonial act of cleansing like John the Baptist did, but a declaration of faith. Faith in what? Faith in the name of Jesus Christ. When someone's baptized, they're telling you, they're telling you, no, no, no, I have discovered that there is salvation in no one else. There's no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved. It's the only way. Jesus said it himself. I'm the way, I'm the truth, I'm life. No one comes to the Father but through me. When someone makes that decision, when someone makes that decision to follow Jesus Christ, to put their faith in Jesus, they are added to the family of God and the movement of God. Remember? They believed, they were baptized, and they were added that day. Throughout this series, we've learned a couple of things. The first week we learned that god's movement starts with god's spirit that's exactly what happened on the day of pentecost right these people are up there they're praying just like we are singing worshiping and all of a sudden the holy spirit comes down and the holy spirit then empowers them and we learned that the following week that god's spirit in us empowers god's movement through us it's not what can do. It's what he can do in us and through us. And it happened, right? Peter stands up, empowered by the Spirit of God, and he begins to proclaim the message of the gospel. And today, today we learn that God's movement requires our response. How will you respond? Will we just listen to it? Or will we respond? Joining God's movement is not about doing a bunch of good works for God. It's about celebrating God's good work for us. Through his son, Jesus Christ, that we would join and say, I am going to respond to the movement. Have you ever? Fearless church, what if God really does want to initiate a mighty multiplication movement among us? What if God wants to do an Acts 2 type movement that radically changes your life? He says, join me, join me in the rapid exponential growth of the church. What if God wants to change our city? Are we just going to listen and say, whoa, what a great story What if God wants to change our city? Are we just gonna listen and say, whoa, what a great story in the first century, Acts chapter two. Are we bold enough and brave enough to be filled with the spirit, empowered by the spirit and go out and become men and women and boys and girls that are disciples who make disciples, become a church that says this message is worthy to be taken to the ends of the earth. The only way, the only way we will actually experience the movement of God and not just become some cool social club with t-shirts that match one another is if we respond to God's movement because God's movement requires our response. So you and I have to decide, how are we gonna respond? Is it something that happened back then? Or is it something that can happen now? This is our generation. This is our time to look at the movement of God and decide, do we want to play church or do we want to join the movement that cannot be stopped? That day, the mighty multiplication movement of God, it started with belief and baptism. So to be completely honest with you, we thought the best way to start the mighty multiplication movement of God in our generation is the same way, belief and baptism. So what we're going to do, we're going to wrap up our service celebrating, celebrating, reminding ourselves what happened that day, 3,000, 3,000. And we don't got 3,000 a day, but we've got some people that would tell you, I'm acknowledging that I was spiritually dead, but I'm alive. Not because I go to church. I'm alive because of Jesus Christ. I've been forgiven, and I am pledging my allegiance to Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. Our appropriate response is not a Southern Baptist, right? Again, I love Southern Baptists. I'm one of them, right? Our response is to celebrate the movement of God, to celebrate the mighty multiplication movement of God. As you see each one of these individuals dunked underneath the water, when they come out, you need to go crazy because God has transformed a life and God is doing a movement among us. So are you ready? I'll be honest with you. It didn't sound like you're really ready but I believe you could do it let's celebrate with the first one Stacy make her way in there Stacy says that the Lord changed my life 17 years ago on her 30th birthday she said I turned from a non-believer to a true believer he literally pointed me in the direction of Fearless Church. She has this amazing story of how God brought her in this season of life to this faith family. And she said, I'm committed to this journey. I'm ready to quote, take the plunge. And I'm committed to working on becoming a fearless follower of Jesus who changes the world. Let's celebrate with Stacy right now. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Next up is Isaac. This is his dad. Matt's going to baptize him. Next up is Isaac. This is his dad. Matt's going to baptize him. Isaac says, I'm being baptized because the Lord Jesus, he doesn't come up short. He's never let me down. Jesus has been there through my best times and through my worst times, even my mistakes. He's not only forgiven me of them, but he helps me make less mistakes, prevents me from making new ones. He says, I want to follow Jesus because every time he forgives me, he said, it feels like he's winking at me like a parent saying, you got this. So let's celebrate with Isaac right now. Amen. Amen. Next is Warren, and this is his dad, Rogers, baptizing him. Rogers and his wife told me, they said last week, they said, man, he just woke up and he said, you know, I know this is a commitment that I want to make to Jesus Christ. I love Jesus. I want to follow Jesus, and I want to be baptized. And they were like, I don't know if you're ready or not yet. You're kind of young. And he kept talking. He said, no, I'm ready. I'm ready to commit my life to Jesus, follow him and live for him. So we're going to celebrate with Warren right now as he's baptized. Y'all are rivaling. That day when 3,000 were baptized, I wonder what a mighty roar it was as they saw, man, God's doing something among us. You're doing an awesome job. And that's his Jessica, and she makes her way to be baptized. She's saying, I believe that Christ Jesus died for me. I believe that he's forgiven my sins. I'm ready to take this step to publicly declare my faith in him. I wanna acknowledge, I wanna pledge my allegiance. From this point on, I choose to follow Jesus. Jesus! Next up, I want to introduce you to Bo. Bo said, I was actually baptized at a young age. However, I'm choosing to be baptized again because I feel like now I really know and understand what it represents. Because I feel like now I really know and understand what it represents. And what I am doing and what it means to be baptized is to give my life completely to Jesus Christ. Let's celebrate with Bo right now. Finally, I want to introduce you to Lucy. Lucy's being baptized by her mom and dad, Steve and Christy, as she makes her way in there. As she is baptized, again, let's celebrate for her, and let's celebrate for all these together. She says, I've been waiting to be baptized for a long time now, and I am, quote, super-duper excited to be baptized because I want to strengthen my relationship with Jesus Christ. I can't wait to be even closer to Jesus in the days, weeks, and years ahead. Let's celebrate with Lucy right now. Thank you. Jesus in the streets Jesus in the darkness Over every enemy Jesus for my family I speak the holy name Jesus Shout Jesus Shout Jesus from the mountains Jesus in the streets Jesus in the darkness over every enemy Jesus for my family My sweet home and day Jesus I sing, oh, say, Jesus. Your name is power. Your name is healing. Your name is life.

True crime podcast people? You guys know who you are? Have you guys seen those Knives Out movies? Anybody? There's something about these mysteries, like crime shows, all that, that like captivate people. We just love these shows, love these things. Like I'm not as big into it. My wife loves true crime podcasts. And so she loves to crochet. And sometimes she'll be crocheting on our couch. She just looks so peaceful. And there's a chance, she has her headphones in, there's a chance she's listening to this book we're listening to called God on Mute about unanswered prayer that is unbelievable. It's this amazing book. There's also a chance she's listening to a true crime podcast looking all nice and hearing things in her ears like, they dismembered his body piece by piece. And you don't know which you don't know what you did too it's like this there's some crazy stuff in there right and they're just cataloging all this these unsolved crimes there's like mystery to it and and it captivates us there's something about us that when you see a puzzle you sort of want to solve it you you get engaged in all that like we used to do there's a period of time in our lives we used to do murder mystery dinners. Anybody done one of those? Where you go and you act out in character. Like you get a character description and you go to this dinner party. And someone like fake dies at the party. And you have to figure out who it was that did it. Man, it's just like, that's another level of weird, number one. But it's just this mystery. We want to try to figure these things out. And for me, I think I have a lower threshold of trying to figure things out than other people. That's why I don't dive as deep into those podcasts. Even at those dinners, I would be there. I enjoy the food. I have this one British accent that isn't good, but it's the only one that I can do. And I would just use that. I'm like, it's enjoyable enough for me to just do my fake British accent, even if the setting isn't like the bayou. I'm still this British guy. I don't know why, but I would enjoy it. I would just sit there through the dinner. I would enjoy it, and at some point, there would be this big reveal where it's like, oh, that was the killer. It was me, you know, whatever. They figure it out. At the end of those true crime podcasts, there's this big reveal of like, oh, the mystery is solved, or maybe it's not, maybe it's still a cold case, but there's this moment where everything comes clear, and I'm like, see, I got the same moment as the people that invested their whole soul into this. Like, there it is, there's the end, it's fine. I didn't have to do the work. I didn't in the mystery as much as other people. And I think this can be true of us and for people. Like we, when there's like a mystery out there, it's easy for us to like get captivated by it and be roped into it and be like excited about it and just enjoy it. But the closer the mystery is to our real normal everyday lives, the more difficult it is when we cannot figure it out. The more it matters to us, and so we put a lot of effort and energy into figuring it out. For instance, if you have a medical diagnosis that is like, we don't know what's wrong with you by a doctor, you're not just like, well, I guess we'll see how this one pans out. There will be some big reveal when I drop dead. Like, hey, somebody figured it out. That's what was wrong with me. Or if you don't know where your next meal is coming from, you don't just say like, I know the kids are hungry, but let's just, let's just leave the mystery there. Let's just see how this pans out. Will food magically appear on the table or not? Like when there's a mystery that's close to our lives, when there's a mystery that matters to us, we tend to take it very seriously. We try to figure these things out. And here's my fear this morning. This is what this has to do with this morning. If you've been with us, you've been coming over the last four weeks, you know that we've been in this series called The Essentials, where we look at these foundational doctrines of the Christian faith, and we've been talking specifically about the doctrine of the Trinity. So there's been an overview week of the Trinity. I preached two weeks ago on the Father. Then Brian preached last week on the Son. And today, today is the week where we talk about the Spirit. And undoubtedly, the Spirit is sort of the most mysterious one of those three persons. Right? Like we can sort of picture God on a throne, sort of like ruling over the earth, creating the earth. We can picture Jesus in a million ways from a million different paintings of him with a baby or feeding the 5,000 or on the cross or floating up in heaven or with a dove descending on his shoulder. Any number of one of those things, we can picture Jesus. But when it comes to picturing the spirit, it's a little weird. Even the imagery in the Bible, they're not really clear. Is the Spirit a who? Is the Spirit a what? Is it those like weird cloven tongues of fire things from Pentecost? What is the Spirit? How do we interact with the Spirit? It's sort of this mysterious person of God that we don't know what to do with. It's sort of this mysterious person of God that we don't know what to do with. And for you and for me, we tend to think, I think sometimes, like, yeah, that's just a mystery out there that does not apply to me. I don't need to spend time figuring it out. Honestly, I'm good with God the Father and with Jesus. And so sort of by association, I guess I'm good with the Spirit too. I'm not gonna put too much effort into figuring it out you're like me at the murder mystery party just being like ah there will be a big reveal at some point and all the mystery will be solved and I don't need to put any time into it and I want to try to shift our understanding of the importance of the spirit of God, because according to Jesus, Jesus himself said this, it is better that I leave so that the spirit will come. And I don't know if you know this, but there's not many things better than Jesus. But if Jesus himself says, it's better that I go so that you can have this version of God, this person of God, that actually can be with every single one of you, indwelling your heart personally, not just one man in human form, God, and man in one, which is Jesus, which is a crazy mystery, but this Spirit of God can dwell in every single one of us. We can't just sort of like punt it because it's weird, right? The Spirit gets this weird reputation because of some of the things we see in Scripture, because of things like speaking in tongues or prophesying or healing or miracles, the things we see in the book of Acts that are like, I don't understand that. It might be easy for us to just sort of say, I can't figure it out, so I'll just pass on this one. We cannot do that. Those of us in the room who are doing that, who are good with God the Father and God the Son, but are not trying in any way to understand how to live with the Spirit as a part of your daily life, in your walk with Jesus, you are limping. You are not capitalizing on the main thing Jesus said would help you become more like him. And so what I want to do this morning is I want to help us gain an understanding and remove some of this mystery a little bit of who the Spirit is and what the purpose of the Spirit is, and then talk about how does that impact my life then. So to talk about how it impacts our life, if you have a Bible, turn to Galatians 5. We're going to land there. We're going to read Galatians 5, 16 through 24. But first, I want to talk through what the purpose of the Holy Spirit is according to Jesus. And i'm going to do that a little bit from the book of john there are a bunch of passages so i don't want to make you like flip back and forth in john all the time and so i'm just going to talk about that you can trust me on this i've read the bible some like you can also go back and look at it like we're going to go through john a little bit so let me let me help us understand what the purpose of the Holy Spirit is from the book of John, and then we'll jump to Galatians 5, which is the fruit of the Spirit comes in. Good with that? All right, so John, the book of John, it's one of the Gospels, is structured in a way where he spends the first 11 chapters talking about the first 33 years of Jesus' life, and then he spends the last nine chapters on one week of his life. It is a drastic slowdown of like, all right, we have flown through all things Jesus. And then they look at really from the triumphal entry on is this like really in-depth look at his teachings, at the things that he says. And from those last nine chapters or so, you would recognize tons of things that Jesus said. Some of those famous quotes come from that, those like nine chapters or so, you would recognize tons of things that Jesus said. Some of those famous quotes come from that, those like nine chapters, like greater love has no man than this, and that a man would lay down his life for his friends, or I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father but by me. He talks about I am the vine, you are the branches, or I go and prepare a place for you in my Father's house. There are many rooms. All these things are from those chapters in John. And in John 14, 15, 16, he starts talking about this thing that he has never mentioned before, which is the Spirit. He calls him the advocate or the helper. And he starts talking about going away and leaving and where he's going to prepare a place for them and that he's the way, the truth, and the life. And he starts talking about this spirit of God, the spirit that's going to come after he leaves. And the disciples are very confused. It's very mysterious as they're hearing about him saying, like, whoa, whoa, whoa, where are you going? Like, we will follow you. We wanna go. They don't quite understand it. there's mystery there, but one thing is clear that he starts talking about this spirit of truth, the Spirit of God that he's going to leave and it's gonna come once he leaves. And in John 16 13 he says this, he says, When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. And I think it's no coincidence that he uses the word truth when he has just described himself as the way, the truth, and the life. He is pointing them to the fact that there is this spirit of God that's gonna show up that's going to help them understand who he is, that's going to reveal some truth to them, all the things that are currently bathed in mystery about where he's going and what's going to happen, the Spirit's going to solve all that. And what's interesting is, that is what happened. When the Spirit came, you see Peter, all the rest of the disciples, go from pretty much fumbling idiots to amazing church leaders. Because something happens, the Spirit of God comes upon them, moves powerfully, and they start doing crazy stuff. They start being really good followers of Jesus if there's a scale. And so I want us to reframe what the purpose of the Holy Spirit is. I want to say this and give us sort of a starting point, a way I would say it. The primary purpose of the Spirit is to guide us to an understanding of Jesus. And not just a mental understanding of who Jesus is, but a true, like, we know Jesus. Bring us into this daily relationship with Jesus. That is the primary purpose of the Spirit. Now, I know that as I say that, there might be some of you who are maybe my more charismatic friends in the room who are a little bit like, I don't know. Like, there's a lot of the doctrines of the Spirit, like, they come from those things. The things like speaking in tongues and prophecy and healings and miracles. And do not get me wrong, and prophecy and healings and miracles and do not get me wrong i've seen some crazy stuff that i cannot explain apart from the spirit of god i believe god can do whatever he wants to do he's god can't put him in a box but the primary purpose of the spirit is not to orchestrate miracles even if you look at pentecost, when the Spirit comes, what was the point of people being able to speak in tongues, speak in languages that they had no knowledge of previously? What was the point? To bring us to an understanding of Jesus. There were people there that otherwise would never have heard the gospel, that never would have come into a relationship and an understanding of who Jesus is, what he came to do, and that they could be saved by grace. That was the primary purpose. All the miracles that are happening, all the powerful signs that you see, they are pointing people that wouldn't otherwise understand who Jesus is to say, this is Jesus. This is God revealed on this earth. You've got to believe in him. The primary purpose of the miracles, the healings, all that stuff, it was to bring people into an understanding of Jesus. That's the primary purpose for them. That's the primary purpose of the Spirit for us. of the Spirit for us. A way I would say it that I'm gonna say a little bit more that may be a little, like it might feel offensive to, and sort of like, I don't know, bringing down the power of God and the Spirit of God and what he can do. It might seem that way at first, but I'll explain why I don't think it is, is that the Spirit works more in the mundane than the miraculous i think many of us have seen some of these things we've grown up in traditions where you see some of this stuff and you don't understand it and it's pushed you away there's too much mystery and so you punt it you don't engage with it but i want you to understand the spirit works more in the mundane everyday moments of our lives than in the miraculous i would say it this way that i think that the spirit of god is more concerned that you spend your life trying to heal the relationships with those around you that have been broken by sin heal the parts of your story that are are seemingly unmentable he wants to heal those things instead of figuring out or he's not as worried about whether or not you can heal the sick. I think he's more concerned that you speak with kindness to your neighbor than whether you speak in tongues. I think he is more concerned with the mundane task of every day casting your cares upon him because he cares for you than whether or not you ever cast out a demon. I think all those things are possible, but the primary purpose of the Spirit is to help us understand who Jesus is. And the Spirit works so much in these mundane moments of our lives, and he actually changes those mundane moments into miraculous moments. Is it not a miracle that I woke up this morning and I'm actually a kind loving gentle person yes you should have known me 10 years ago the Spirit of God day to day is doing miracles in my life to change my my natural tendencies my sinful fleshly desires he is working in the mundane to change me into the image of Jesus that's a miracle and he's doing it for me and he wants to do it with you so the question is how then do we step into this that's where we'll land in Galatians chapter 5 if you turn there I'm not gonna put it up on the screen just because it's a longer section of scripture. If you have a Bible, you can follow along with me. But if you don't, just listen to the passage. I'm gonna read it. I'm gonna read 16 through 24. This is what Paul writes when he's talking about the spirit. He says, I say, walk by the spirit and you will not gratify, you won't fulfill the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit. The desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But if you're led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. There's a lot going on here. We're not going to get into all that. But now the works of the flesh are evident. here we're not going to get into all that but now the works of the flesh are evident sexual immorality impurity sensuality idolatry sorcery enmity strife jealousy fits of anger rivalries dissensions divisions envy drunkenness orgies and sun things like these i warn you as i warned you before that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of god here comes the part you probably know, but the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law, and those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. For many of us, that passage is familiar, at least the second part. It's a familiar passage that I think we sometimes, when reading it in total and hearing both of those things i think we might be tempted to interpret it a little bit wrong we hear that last verse those who are in christ jesus have crucified the flesh along with its passions and desires or see that that warning up at the top where paul's sort of like shaking his finger i warn you like i warned you before those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. We hear language like that, and I think it tempts us to look at those two lists as sort of like a proof as to whether or not we're saved or which team we are on. As if like if I do any of the things that are in list A, I am automatically now not a Jesus follower. I can't be a Christian because anyone who does those things will not inherit the kingdom of God. Or we look at list B and say, man, if we're not doing those things, it's almost as though the spirit of God is not in us because the fruit would be, we would see those things. It's a proof. And if we're not doing list B, We also may not be a child of God. And that can't be right, correct? It cannot be that anybody who is participating in any of the things from list A and not fully participating in all of the things from list B is not a Jesus follower. I think we're all out, right? Who hasn't dabbled in light sorcery? Like it can't be a proof. It can't be that, right? That's honestly contrary to the gospel. We know that we are saved by faith. And that when we are saved, we still sin and struggle with sin. And if we confess our sin, he is faithful and just to forgive confess our sin, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sin, of course. And until we are fully made one with Christ, whether in death or when he comes back, like there's some part of it that we're not going to be perfect like our heavenly father is perfect, though we are striving to do so. He's not laying out a proof of whether or not you are saved, comparing yourself to list A and B. He's laying out two paths. One path that follows the leading of the Spirit of God, and one path that follows the leading of our fleshly desires. And they are two paths that he says are very opposed to one another. They're against one another. And at the end of a path, there is what? A destination. It leads somewhere. And as he's painting this picture, he's saying, all right, if you follow after the spirit, the destination that you're going to find somewhere out there is love, joy, peace, a life of faithfulness, kindness. It's almost as though he's describing what it would look like to live in the kingdom of God. But that ultimate destination of those who are living that way will slowly become more and more like Jesus and end up that way. And the other path, if we walk down that one, it has a destination. It not only has a final destination, but it has moment-by-moment consequences. In the way that we order our lives, if we do some of these things from list A and we participate in these things, it's going to have momentary consequences and frustrating things of our sin and breaking our relationships in the world that we live in. All the brokenness is there, but it also has a final destination in which we will likely not become people who inherit the kingdom of God. There are these two separate and distinct paths, following the spirit, following the flesh. And that's why paul has to in the very first part of that in verse 16 give a command of walk by the spirit as if it's a choice that we have he's pointing them and i want to point you to this question, which path are you on? Again, the lists are not proofs, but which list describes your life more accurately? Are you a person that is seeking to daily follow after the Spirit of God and is leading in such a way that your life looks more loving, joyful, peaceful, patient, kind, good, faithful, gentle, and self-controlled than it did five years ago? Or is the path you're on one of just doing what your heart desires naturally, ignoring the things that the Spirit would call you to and just keep taking more steps down that path? And I want you to understand, the last thing I want to do is be up here talking about these lists and turning this into sort of something that brings guilt or shame on any of you. It's the last thing I want. I think people that have been in my position many times on a stage with a microphone, preaching as sort of like a religious leader in some sense, have used this passage to weaponize it and to sort of like shame people, trying to get them into the kingdom. And that is by no means what i'm trying to do what i'm telling you is that you are if you are walking down the path of the flesh and you are giving into your desires you are living a life you don't have to live. The consequences of that path are probably pretty clear to you if you're walking down that path. If you're sitting here wrestling with fear and anxiety and guilt and shame, and you're sort of apathetic towards the people that love you most and you're not self-controlled and all the things that you think you're here and list B that you want to be, you're not those things. Don't you want to not be there anymore? Don't you want a different way? I say this to say, there's another road. There's another path and it's up to you to choose which one you are on. And you're not just sent out there on your own the spirit of God is calling you to walk down the path that he has paved for you through the blood of Jesus he has made a way for you to jump back on that path and find a life that you don't wake up every morning just crushed by the weight of your sin. But choosing to follow the Spirit of God as he leads you into becoming a person who looks a lot more like List B, aka a lot more like Jesus. And I don't think you can find a more loving, joyful, peaceful, kind, good, faithful person than Jesus. And I wanna remind us that the Spirit works more in the mundane than the miraculous. And for some of you, when you hear me talk about those paths, you're like, man, for me to get back on the path of the Spirit would take a miracle. I need the miraculous. It's the mundane that's killing me. It's the day-to-day choices that I'm making that are just frustrating me and that I can't escape these patterns of thought or these patterns of sin or these things. It would take a miracle to save. It would take a miracle to rescue me, it would take a miracle, a lightning bolt from heaven to just zap me over to the other path, I can't do it. And here's the thing, and this is true of every single thing in your life, spiritual or not, that is really good for your overall health, daily is difficult. You can't just eat a ton of salad one day a month and look the way you want, right? You can't just exercise all the muscles once a month. You can't run 15 miles, do a bunch of pushups, squat. Nobody likes squats. Like, whatever, burpees. Like, you can't do it once a month. You've got to eat right and exercise every day. You've got to drink however many ounces of water. They say you're supposed to drink every day. You have to take a multivitamin. You have to do It's every day. And nobody likes doing that every day, right? Because daily is difficult. But what I want you to understand is that's why the Spirit of God is not just there to perform one miracle. The Spirit of God is there to walk with you every single day, daily. I want to give you sort of an exercise that I hope will be easy. Again, it's going to be difficult because daily is difficult, but I want to give you a daily exercise to try to help us as we try to be more in line with the spirit or walk by the spirit as paul says all right i did not make this up i did not invent this a really old dude named ignatius he was one of the saints early church fathers he invented this and it's still something that people do today but it's this prayer exercise called the examine the people who are part of ford dayton which is the church that i pastor they're gonna be like oh gosh okay we've heard this six thousand times like but this is something that i have done in my life and has brought unbelievable meaning to my life it is a prayer exercise in which you sort of just review your day we made up these cars to help you could just stick it in your bible put it up and if you want one i have a limited amount everybody's first service stole a million of them so i have some but it's also on our social media. If you follow 4Day on Instagram, it's on our story or Facebook, you can find it there. You can Google the exam and you will find all this there as well. The internet's actually pretty big. So you can find this, but it's four simple steps. It's four simple steps. The first step is to reflect on your day. So you go and you find somewhere where you won't have distractions, you put your phone away, and you just sort of think through the things that you did that day. Where did you go? What did you do? Who did you see? How was your day? You get your day in mind, and then you ask these two questions back to back. The first question is, when in my day did I feel furthest from God? Was When in my day did I feel furthest from God? Was it something I did? Was it something I said? Was it a moment of tension or frustration relationally with someone? Is it a way I lashed out in anger at someone? Was it something I thought of, a negative thought pattern that I just let keep going in my mind that took me down a dark road? Was it just sitting there doom scrolling on Instagram and just like comparing myself to every single other person in the world? Like, what was the moment where you felt furthest from God? And again, this is not to bring shame or guilt on you and have a day, a daily exercise where you feel bad about yourself. That's not the goal. It's actually quite the opposite. I'll tell you what it's done for me. For me, there is a moment every single day that I do this where I get to confess my sin to God, think through my day, and say, when did I feel furthest from you? Ah, I messed up here and there. And this is the beauty of it. I never go more than 24 hours, as long as I do it daily, carrying the burden and the weight of my own sin. There's a moment every single day where I get to hear the voice of God, not audibly, but know what he says about me in his word. I hear him speak over me. I forgive you. I took care of that on the cross. Put it down. And for some of you, you've been carrying a burden for 24 years, not 24 hours. Can you imagine the freedom you step into if you would daily sit before your heavenly father, the spirit of God brings to mind the things that you sort of struggle with from that last day. And he speaks to you and says, hey, it's okay. I've got you. Keep going. That's what this moment is meant to be. It's not a list of confessing your sin and feeling shame. It's a path to freedom. And after you ask that question of when did I feel furthest from God, you sort of ask the inverse. When did I feel closest to God? What was it that I did? Was there a moment where I sort of just went and prayed or read scripture or listened to a sermon or I read a book or went on a walk or a hike. It was just out and away from all the distractions of the world. When did I feel closest to God? And you reflect on that and you thank God for that time, for anything that was revealed to you in that. You practice gratitude for all the things that he's blessed you with in that day. And then you move to the fourth step, which is just to think about the day that's coming ahead. You say, okay, what am I gonna do? Who am I gonna see? And you think about all of the meetings you have, maybe. Think about if you're a parent, your children, and what's going on in their lives. And maybe you take a moment to just pray for more patience for your children, because you probably need it the next day. Like you pray for the people you're gonna see in any meetings that you have. And you sort of, it's this weird thing. It's almost as though you are inviting this mystical unseeable spirit to walk with you for the next day. And when you look back on your day from the day before, it's almost as if you're inviting this spirit to show up and bring to mind things that you could improve on your day. It's almost as though you're walking by the spirit. It is this momentary thing. It's amazing how when I am reflecting on my day before and looking at my day ahead, I do that all the time. It's amazing how then in the day that I am living today, knowing that I was going to be preaching here or knowing that I'm going to see X person, I have actually already prayed for them. I have already thought about the conversation. I am remembering things about their life and I'm asking God to help me to be encouraging to them it's amazing how i feel like the spirit of god is present with me in all those moments to look back and then to look forward somehow develops in us this relationship with the spirit right now this is what the Spirit desires for us. God, in his infinite knowledge, saw forward to the moment when Jesus would be gone on this earth and said, I think they're all going to need part of me in their life every single day in the mundane moments to bring about the miracle that is following Jesus. He knew it, and he sent the Spirit to help you. That's the purpose of the Spirit of God, to be with you in every single moment, guiding you, pushing you further down that path of walking by the Spirit, keeping in step with the Spirit, not limping along in our walk with Jesus, but running forward as he shows us the way and the path to freedom. This is the Spirit's role. Which path are you going to choose? And here's my last word of encouragement. For some of you, I'm sure in the room, there's part of you that feels like, I hear you, but I'm too far down the other path. I've run too far away from God for too long. It's going to take me years to walk it back. I've run 20 years down this path, this pattern of sin in my life, this fleshly desire that I have allowed to just burn like wildfire. There's no way I can walk it back. You don't understand. This is my encouragement to you. You can never stray too far from the path. You are never too far from God. I don't know if you remember the story in Luke 15 of the prodigal son, but he runs away and he does a lot of the things from list A. And he feels shame and he gets into a spot that he can't figure it out on his own, and so he makes a plan to go back, and he has this speech rehearsed in his mind. The scripture literally details his speech that he's going to give from his mind, and he goes, and his father runs up to him, even when he's still a long way away, and he starts to give his speech. He's got all these, he's geared himself up for it. He's like, father, I way away, and he starts to give his speech. He's geared himself up for it. He's like, Father, I have some... And he gets hit by the father because his father is like, shut up, I don't care. He just wraps his arms around him. And the son, he felt shame. He felt like less than. He felt like all the things he did disqualified him. Like he could never get back. He wanted to be just a servant in the household because he didn't see himself as a son. He didn't see himself as a child of the father anymore. And some of you feel like that. And I promise you, at the moment you start to give your rehearsed speech and say, God, father, his arms are going to wrap around you. Somehow it's this weird Jesus magic that because of what he did on the cross, he would just pick you up off that path as soon as you don't want to be on it anymore and place you right back on the path that the Spirit is guiding you. It is as though you will hear the things that Jesus says in this book, that God the Father speaks over us. You are my son. You are my daughter. It echoes the words of Jesus when that woman is caught in adultery and he looks around after he's sort of like owns the audience and everyone is left. He's like, well, does no one condemn you? Then neither do I. Go and sin no more. He points her down the right path. And it seems like an impossible path, but for the Spirit of God. Jesus, when he came, he's Emmanuel, right? He's God with us. And that's a funny thing to say when you literally say, I will never leave you or forsake you, and then transport up into heaven and float away. It's really weird to say, I will never leave you or forsake you and then transport up into heaven and float away. It's really weird to say, I'm not leaving. But for the Spirit of God, the one that he sent, who is with every single one of us in this moment, moving those mundane moments to miraculous moments, walking with us every single step of the way. If you feel like you are too far down the path, call on your father. He's ready. He's gonna say, I told you, I loved you. I just proved it. Come on back. Keep trying. Keep going. I'm here. Which path are you on? Which one are you gonna walk down? The choice is yours. Which one are you gonna pick? Let me pray. God, I thank you for your spirit that you sent to walk with us, to give us yourself. You, the creator of the universe, are with us here now, and not just with us corporately, you're with each one of us individually. Help us to make room for you. Help us to pick the path that leads to love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Those are the things we want to be known as. Those are the things we want you to form in us. Give us the strength to daily, even though it's difficult, run after you and run down the path right alongside your spirit. Help us not to limp along. We love you. And it's in your son's name that we pray. Amen."}]}

Welcome to Fearless Church. We are so excited to have you here. Whether you're joining me from your living room, your kitchen, I'm pumped to be in your bedroom. My name is Chris Volz, and I'm one of the teaching pastors here. I'm so excited to be able to hear all the stories of everything that God's been doing through His people and through Fearless Church. We launched a week ago, and we didn't realize it was going to be online, but it is. And I want to encourage you, even though we are disconnected, and I'm preaching to an empty room right now, God's Spirit, He connects us. Even though the body might feel a little bit disjointed, His Spirit connects us to one another all over the globe, all over our country, all over Dayton, Ohio. There are people meeting and gathered together. His Spirit is not, there's nothing about this room that makes his spirit more prevalent. He's there with you. I wanna thank you for being the body of Christ, for serving one another. I've heard so many stories of you guys going out and loving on your neighbors, caring for them. And I couldn't be more excited to join in. If you're one of the people who need some help, excited to join in. If you're one of the people who need some help, we'd love to hear from you. Message us on Instagram, on Facebook. We'd love to know what you need and if there's anything we can do to stretch our arms out and to love and care for you in this crazy season. And I think sometimes in life, when things get crazy like they are right now, we refer to it as a storm. We refer to it as it as this crazy storm of life. And it reminded me of storms that I used to watch when I was a kid. I'm from Indianapolis, Indiana, and we have corn, and it is flat, and every once in a while there's a tornado or something. But we used to go to the beach in South Carolina, and I would love to watch the storms that would happen over the ocean. The wind would swell, and you'd get these massive waves, and I would see sometimes these bolts of lightning just like shoot over top of the ocean. You could see the clouds. You could see the clouds light up over the ocean, and it was awesome. I loved watching it as a kid. I wasn't scared and hiding away. I would press in. I would be right up against like a screen door window and or a glass window and just watch the storm. And there's something interesting about the storm. Even when it passes, it's cool because you get to see the changes that happen. When there's a storm on the beach, it can be storming at 2 p.m. and then by 3 p.m., everybody's back out on the beach, ready to go, having fun. But you can see what the storm has changed. You can see what has shifted because of the wind, because of the rain. You see maybe you built a sandcastle in the morning and it got completely demolished by that storm. Maybe there's some debris that has washed up onto the shore that wasn't there before. And one of the ways I feel like the storm shifts things and changes things is I went downstairs after one of these storms, and I remember looking at the posts that hold those beach houses up, right? There's a bunch of posts that sort of are dug down deep into the ground to make sure that when a storm comes, it's real bad and the waves come all the way in, that that house doesn't get washed away. I remember looking at those posts after a storm. And before the storm, there's sand caked up around it from just the wind and people kicking sand on it. And you can't really see where it attaches and where it joins into the ground. But after the storm has come and gone, I remember going down and looking at one of those posts and seeing it completely clean. The wind had stripped all that sand away. The rain has pelted it down. And you can see exactly where that big, massive wooden post goes down into the ground and connects and provides that solid foundation for that house. And what I want us to sort of think through when it comes to storms and what they do in that story is that storms can reveal what is under the surface. In that storm specifically, you see this post. Before, there was stuff caked around it, and you couldn't really see it clearly, but once the storm came and went, you could see what was under the surface of it. You could see that post for what it was. And I think in this storm, in this season of our lives, this storm is revealing some things about our culture, about humanity, and some positive, some negative. I was talking to a guy named Brian the other night. We were recording a podcast together, talking about just some honest conversations of how people are processing during this time of the coronavirus spreading all over the place. And he admitted that he was on a sales call. He has this client, he's in marketing. And he said, for one of the first times, I was talking to this guy and I wasn't trying to upsell my product. I wasn't trying to just seal the deal. I saw that client, not as just a client and a number, a dollar sign. I saw him as a person with a family who was affected by this. And so I asked him some questions, and I started to get to know him a little better and see how his family has been affected by this, how his life has changed, if he's fearful about his business and all that kind of stuff. And for Brian, this storm revealed something about his character that he actually does care for people. And so I think it's revealed some things about our community as well. It's revealed that, it's revealed some things about our community as well. It's revealed that it's done. This is so annoying. Should I stop? Should I keep going? I need some water. I will be right back. I can't believe that happened. Got my water. Give me one second. Great. Here we go. So right here, I will not stop again. Sound good? Thank you. Take two. Not only was it revealing for Brian about what he cared about, I've also seen all of you, this storm is revealing that we care about our neighbors. We care about others more than ourselves. We are trying to inconvenience ourselves for the sake of those in our community who might be affected by this disease, even if we are not. Keep doing it. I'm so excited to hear these stories of you who have sacrificed for your neighbors. So I think this storm has revealed a lot of things in the positive, but I also think that this storm is revealing something that is a little bit negative as well for a lot of us i think about that that sand caked around that foundation post of the beach house and i think for some of us what this storm is doing is it's washing away some of the things um that and are revealing for us where our foundation is, where our security lies. And it's making us a little bit uneasy. It's a little bit causing us to question, where is my security found? What do I trust in? And I think it's because for a lot of us, there are things that 10 days ago, you were so sure of, and now they are so uncertain. 10 days ago, I would have told you, I think I could drive to Walmart right now and buy a can of green beans, right? And honestly, right now, I probably still could go get a can of green beans. Nobody wants that. They're getting more essential things. But like, I don't know if stuff will be on the shelves at grocery stores to meet my essential needs. 10 days ago, I would have told you there's no way I can't just drive to a grocery store and find everything that I absolutely need. 10 days ago, most of you would have thought, well, if I get into a bind and I need someone to to watch my kids while I go to work you would have been so certain like I can find somebody I can go on Facebook and post and find someone to watch my kids I could pay them but schools are closed daycares are closed everyone else is looking for childcare right now so that they can work and it's becoming more and more unsure as to whether or not you can find that 10 days ago you would have said man i can i can go on amazon and i can pretty much buy whatever i want and in two days it'll be at my house that's no longer certain for a lot of us even in more serious terms 10 days ago you might have well, I know I'm going to get a paycheck in two weeks. But right now, you're not sure. You're not sure if in four weeks, you're going to get a paycheck. For some of you, your business has been climbing. You've been doing really well. And 10 days ago, you would have been thinking, like, there's no way that my business is going to decline. We are crushing it. And now, this morning, you're worried about whether or not your business is going to make it. You're on the verge of bankruptcy, almost already thinking about what is going to happen in the next few weeks. If something doesn't change, you are sunk. Some of you, you've seen your 401k, your retirement, you've seen it tank in the last 10 days. For some of you, it's not even financial or any of that. It's about your physical life. 10 days ago, you were planning on spending a family vacation together with your family, and you're at an age and stage where you're not even sure if that family vacation is going to happen, and if you caught the virus would you even survive to get there nothing is certain in this storm and this storm is revealing about about you and about me that we're asking ourselves this question and if you're not already you need to be asking yourself this question what is my anchor you need to be asking yourself this question, what is my anchor? What am I holding on to that's going to allow me to not just be tossed back and forth in the midst of this storm? Where is my security found? Because you're in the storm right now. I'm in the storm right now. The waves are high. Things are changing so rapidly that we can't even predict what two days from now is going to be like. And this storm reminds me of a storm in scripture. When Jesus was here on the earth, he had 12 followers, 12 disciples. One of them's name was Peter. And Peter, there's a story of him in the book of Matthew, where the disciples all get into a boat and they go to go across a lake. Peter was a fisherman. A lot of the disciples were fishermen, so they've been in a storm before, but they're in this boat, they're going across a lake, and this storm arises. Jesus isn't with them on the boat, and they're fine. They're going to make it through the storm, okay. But then they see something that's a little terrifying to them. They see someone walking in the distance on the water. And they get a little bit scared, and they cry out, is that a ghost? What is that? It's a ghost. And Jesus, being Jesus, calls out and says, no, no, no, don't be afraid. It's me. And Peter responds first like he always does. And he says, Lord, if it's really you, ask me to come out to you on the water. And to me, if that were me, I would have maybe come up with a different request, like, Jesus, if it's really you, you know, just give me the sign, or, you know, whatever it is, baseball sign. Like, I'm not asking him to call me out to take a step onto the water, but that's what Peter does, because Peter's crazy. And the crazier thing is that not only does Jesus say, yes, come out to me on the water, the crazier thing is that Peter does it. Can you imagine being in the midst of a storm on a boat, the wind and the waves crushing down on you, and you're trying to figure out, okay, is he taking his foot, is he putting it down over onto the water and testing it out? What is he doing? Is he trying to stomp on it to see if his foot will go through? Imagine yourself in that moment taking a step out of a boat and onto the waves. And the scripture says that he actually walked on the water towards Jesus. And what happens in this moment is as he's on the water, it says that he sees the strong wind, and he sees the waves, and he begins to be fearful. He begins to sink, and immediately he cries out like, help, Lord, save me, and Jesus reaches out, and he grabs him, help, Lord, save me, and Jesus reaches out and he grabs him, and he saves him. And in that moment, yeah, Peter's faith, it wavered. In the midst of the storm, Peter's faith wavered, but what we know about Peter is that as life goes on and as he continues to grow and mature, he becomes one of the foundational leaders of the church that Jesus started after he was crucified and buried and then rose from the dead. He becomes one of the leaders, and he actually writes a book. He writes a couple books in the New Testament that we have recorded in our Bible, and I want to look at the words of Jesus, of Peter. I want to look at the words of Peter as one who has been in the waves with Jesus in the midst of a storm. So if you have your Bible, turn with me to 1 Peter. We're going to look at verses 3 and 4 this morning, but it's interesting because in this first chapter of 1 Peter, Peter is writing to some believers that are not very much different than you and I. to some believers that are not very much different than you and I. Peter starts writing to these believers who are scattered in different regions around one country that is all ruled by the Roman government. He's writing, it says, to the dispersion or those who are dispersed across the Roman government and all these different provinces that are being persecuted by that government. And so they're in the hideout. They're in hiding in these different house churches all over the place. And for you and for me, we may not be under persecution, but we are in different house churches right now. We're all, you are all sitting somewhere, and I don't think that Peter had Facebook Live, but he was writing and communicating a message of hope to them in this ridiculously uncertain time. And so I want to read for us what Peter writes in 1 Peter 1, verse 3. He says this, All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is by his great mercy that we've been born again, because God raised Jesus Christ from the dead. And he says, now we live with great expectation. And I want to remind us what Peter reminded them. He's writing to these people that are greatly fearful, that are greatly uncertain of everything that is going on in their life, and he reminds them of something first and foremost, and it's this, that God's mercy towards us hasn't changed. In the midst of all sorts of changes, of all sorts of shifts in the landscape, God's mercy towards us has not changed. And I want us to remember that today. I want you to remember, because I think so quickly we forget that God's love, his grace, his mercy still applies to you, still applies to me. My salvation is as secure as it's ever been. still applies to me. My salvation is as secure as it's ever been. And I think it's easy for us to, in times when there's chaos, when we don't know what's going on, it's easy for us to feel like God forgot about us. It's easy for us to ask the question, where is God in all of this? And I want to remind us from Scripture, God's people, again and again and again, have been remembered by their Lord. Back when the children of Israel were in slavery in Egypt, because of what they did to get there, God saved them. He remembered them, and he sent Moses to deliver them from Egypt. When God's people were in exile, he had planned to send Jesus to come and to rescue them, right? Even these believers that Peter is writing to in the first century, they made it out. That's why we're here today. They made it through the persecution. The church continued to grow and grow and grow until it is what it is today. And in this season, in this storm, God has not forgotten about our church. God has not forgotten about his church, his people. His mercy towards us has not changed. If you have confessed with your tongue and believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus from the dead, you are saved, and nothing is going to change that. No virus can change that. And it's because our salvation is certain that Peter goes back and he says something that's astounding at the end of this verse. He says, now we live with great expectation. Because God has raised Jesus from the dead, now, now we live with great expectation. And I don't know about you, but for me, when I look at this current season, this current storm that we're in, I'm not thinking, man, I have great expectations for what's to come. I'm not thinking like, oh man, I'm so excited about what two days from now is going to happen. I'm just trying to figure out if I go to Walmart, will I be able to buy a can of green beans, right? Like we are trying to just survive this season. We have no expectations of what is to come other than just making it through. But what Peter reminds us of is that his mercy hasn't changed, and therefore, because our salvation is secure, he says this. He says, we have a priceless inheritance, an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you, pure, undefiled, beyond the reach of change and decay. Because our salvation is secure, our inheritance is secure, and what that means for us is that our future hasn't changed either. And you might be thinking, well, our future has definitely changed. I don't know what's gonna happen three weeks from now. I have no idea how to predict or how to plan or how to do anything in this current climate. Our future has definitely changed. But I'm not talking about this life. I'm not talking about two weeks from now. I'm talking about our eternal hope in Christ. If you are a believer in Jesus, the fact that his mercy hasn't changed and his mercies are new every morning and your salvation is secure, your inheritance that that salvation has bought, it hasn't changed. It hasn't faded. I love the way Peter writes. He said, it is beyond the realm of change or decay. Our future hasn't changed. our future hasn't changed. I know that I'm a child of God, and no matter what this virus brings, no matter what I lose, I have gained Christ. And I know him. And more importantly, he knows me. And he calls me his own. But I want to challenge us. I want to push us a little bit, because there's a lot of us, some of us in the room, or in your room, you might be thinking, like, well, yeah, yeah, that's good. I believe that. I know that. And you nod along. But I want you to really think about the way that you're responding to this storm because the storm reveals what's under the storm surface the storm reveals for us where our foundation actually lies and even if you would nod along and say yeah yeah I believe I believe that my future is secure, a lot of us are not acting like that's true. And I want you to think through, is my faith genuine? I say I believe in Jesus. I say I believe in God. I say that my trust is in Him and in Him alone. But as this storm comes, I want you to ask yourself, what is it revealing in your heart? What is it revealing that you're holding on to? Are you holding on only to Jesus as your anchor? Or are you holding on to Jesus and your retirement? Are you holding on to Jesus and control of my future? And I think for a lot of us, we need to be reminded that we're not citizens of this world. This is not our home. This is not our future. This is not our future. Our future is with Christ. And no matter what happens in this season, in the year 2020, no matter how long this lasts, you gotta answer the question, what is my anchor, honestly? Because if this, if the season of the coronavirus comes and goes, and you don't really take time to evaluate and look at what the storm is revealing in you, what a waste it would be. And for those of you that maybe you're tuning in today because you don't know Jesus, you don't follow Jesus, and you're trying to think of what the church is doing to respond. You've heard about this church called Fearless Church, and you're like, I wonder how they're responding to all of this. I want to read it a different verse. It's a verse from Proverbs. It says this, that when the storms of life come, the wicked or the ungodly or those who don't know Jesus, I would say, are a world away. But the godly have a lasting foundation. And I want you to know, if you don't know Jesus, Jesus is that lasting foundation. Jesus is our anchor in this storm. Jesus is the one that we're holding on to. And if you don't know what to hold on to, hold on to him. He is the only thing that is beyond the reach of change or decay in this world. The last 10 days has revealed that there is nothing certain about our lives right now, but I'm telling you, I'm begging you to believe that Jesus is the one constant, unchanging variable that you can hold on to and trust. And I want to go back to this story of Peter. And I want to look at it. This story of Peter walking on the water, I want to conclude by talking about how that story ends. It says this in Matthew 14. It says, so Peter went over the side of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus. What an incredible moment. And when he saw the strong wind and the waves, he was terrified and began to sink. And he said, save me, Lord. Jesus immediately reached out and grabbed him. And listen to Jesus' response in this moment. He says, you have so little faith. And he asked this question that I don't want us to miss. He says, why did you doubt me? And that question, I'm afraid, will haunt a lot of us at the end of this storm. I believe the storm will reveal for us something about ourselves, that in the midst of the storm, we're gonna take our eyes off of Jesus. We're gonna see the strong wind and the waves and we are going to be the people who look away and we start to sink. And Jesus won't audibly ask us like he asked Peter, why did you doubt me? But that will be the question that haunts you. You're gonna have to ask yourself, why did you doubt me? But that will be the question that haunts you. You're going to have to ask yourself, why did I doubt him? I said I believe in Jesus. I think I believe in Jesus. But your faith right now is being shaken. You're starting to see the strong wind. You're starting to see the waves. And you're starting to sink. And I think the reason that we doubt, I think the reason that we fear, I think the reason that we're doing that is because we're confused about what being safe and secure means. I think we're confused about where our security lies. Because for Peter, Peter's a fisherman. Peter could have stayed in the boat. Peter knows how to navigate a ship. For Peter, the safest place for him, I think, logically, would have been in the boat. For me, in the middle of a storm, I think it makes sense that you should stay in that boat as long as you can. And for us, in the middle of this storm, I think for a lot of us, logically, we're trying to figure out, okay, I need to stay where I'm comfortable. I need to stay where it's safe. I need to grab up control of whatever I can grab onto to weather this storm. And so we're trusting in our abilities and our talents and our ability to plan and get through this. We're trusting in ourselves. We're trying to grab up control. But the place that is safest to be in the midst of the storm is ironically not in the boat. It's standing on the waves with Jesus, right next to you, able to reach out and grab you if you fall. For some of you, I want to press you. I want to push you. Get out of the boat. Release control. Stop trying to worry your way into surviving this. Let go of your fear. Let go of your your anxiety stop trying to plan all this get out of the boat stop holding on to you got one foot out on the water and you've got one foot holding on to control I'm telling you the safest place to be is out of that boat standing on the water standing on the waves next to the one who can, in one sentence, calm the entire storm. Rest in him. Find your comfort in him. He is your anchor. Let me pray. Let me pray. Let me pray. God, I thank you for the opportunity to hear your word and know that whether we're in this room or whatever room we're in, that your word applies to us, that your word is true. No matter the status of our meeting or our ability to congregate, you are here with us. Your mercy towards us hasn't changed. Your love for us hasn't changed. Our future is more secure than it's ever been if our future is in your hands. I pray that we would release our fear. We would get out of the boat, step out onto the water, and sprint towards you. You are our anchor in this storm. And with you, we will weather in. Amen."}]}

How do we do that? How do we wrestle with that? And so today, we want to talk about that tension. And we want to figure out how do we resist isolation in the midst of this quarantine. And so to sort of think through that and have a little bit of fun with it, I want you to take 30 seconds and come up with your quarantine experience in six words okay so I'll give you an example mine my quarantine experience in six words is snack time all day every day snack time all day every day this quarantine has been horrible for my eating habits either way you figure out yours text it to a friend post it in our comment section below whatever or just have it in your mind, but come up with your six-word quarantine experience. I'm going to put 30 seconds on the timer, and then we're going to hear from Pastor Chris. Well, good morning, Fearless Church. My name is Pastor Chris Williams, and I have the honor and privilege of serving as your lead pastor. I want to thank you for joining us on Facebook, YouTube, or our website this morning. In fact, for all the fearless kids out there, okay, so if you're a fearless kid and you are watching with mom and dad somewhere, whether it's in your living room or you're all cuddled up in bed together, whatever it may be, I want to invite you to jump up real quick and give me the fearless fist bump, okay? So come up here. Come on. Get up here. Get up here. Here we go. Three, two, one, boom! Awesome. Awesome. Thank you so much. Boom. Awesome. Awesome. Thank you so much. We're glad to have you guys join us this morning as we continue our message series entitled Fear Less and Love More. Well, Fearless Church is based out of Dayton, Ohio. And this last Tuesday, our governor, Governor Mike DeWine, issued a stay-at-home order. And so all of us in our community, we've been getting used to, okay, this is what it looks like to work from home. And obviously many of our kids have already been doing school from home. And it's been an unusual time and season of transition. And I know it's not just for us in Ohio. Many people around the United States, as well as globally, have very similar orders where you're staying at home, trying to curtail the spread of the coronavirus. So thank you so much for doing that and participating in that. But it makes for an unusual season, honestly, of ministry. I've had the honor and privilege of serving as a pastor for over 20 years now, and this, without a doubt, is the most unusual season I've ever faced as a pastor. You know, Jesus was asked one time this question, and the question was, Jesus, out of all the commandments in the Bible, which one is the most important? And Jesus looked at this dude and he said, look, the most important thing to remember, the most important commandment is this, love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your soul, with all your strength, and there's a second one that's just as important, and that is love your neighbor as yourself. So when Jesus was asked to basically sum up all the law and the prophets and to just say, this is the most important thing, he said, look, loving God and loving people is the most important thing. So honestly, if you were to simplify my job description or any job description of any pastor. It's our job to the best of our ability, empowered by the Spirit of God, to help you love God and love people. And here's the crazy thing is, it is really, really, really difficult to love someone that you don't know. In fact, I like to say it this way, we don't love who we don't know. So the question is, well, how do I get to say it this way we don't love who we don't know so the question is well How do I get to know somebody well we get to know? Somebody by spending time with them by communicating with them by connecting with them, and it's hard enough to help people Know and love a God who they cannot see in fact That's the reason why Jesus came Jesus came as a manual God with us to give us God in the flesh someone that we could know and connect with on a personal level. Now, I know that doesn't apply for us in this generation, but almost 2,000 years ago when he came, this was God's desire that we could know him and walk with him in a very personal way. And it's hard enough in 2020 to help people know and love a God who they cannot hear, see, or touch. But then we have the second part of loving our neighbors ourself and all of a sudden because of the coronavirus because of the stay-at-home orders we've been issued we've got this challenge of really getting to know and love one another without being around one another and that's challenge like how do we do this you know i keep seeing and hearing this phrase it's this man, we'll get through this together. And it's inspiring, it's motivating, it's encouraging, but it's still a little bit weird because we're not able to get together. Like a couple of weeks ago, I got this stomach virus. And especially in light of all the corona stuff, my wife and kids were like, dude, whoa, whoa, like stay away from me. So they actually did quarantine me up in my bedroom. And I remember it's funny because my wife would come and check on me multiple times a day. And one time she's staying at the door far away as possible from the bed and from me. And she says, look, I'm here for you. I'm not there for you. I'm over here for you. Cause she knew she didn't want to get close to me because she didn't want to get to the virus. And that's what's weird is we have to be careful even how we say it because we're here for each other, but we're not really there for each other. Like we can't be around each other. And so this is crazy. And here at Fearless Church, we have something we call the fearless code. And the fearless code is simply our distinct values that make up our unique identity and culture as a church. It's what makes us who we are. And part of the fearless code is this. We say that we believe that there is strength in numbers. And this is the idea that every one of us, we all need a team, a tribe, a crew, a band of brothers to push us to be brave and actually face our fears and rise to the challenge to be all who God has made us to be and do all that God has made us to do. And here's the reality. This value is so important right now in the life of our church. And the reason why is because we face this great challenge of the coronavirus and we have to go at this thing together yet we're not allowed to be together so why is this so important well last week pastor Chris volts did an amazing job if you missed his message I want to challenge you to go to our website it's be fearless org and check out his message he did an awesome job and he challenges he says when we face a storm when we face a trial in our life we better have have an anchor. And who or what is going to be your anchor in the storm? And the reality is, and this was kind of the culmination of his message, is that Jesus Christ and Christ alone is the only thing that's going to be that stabilizing anchor in the midst of the storm. So how do we hold to this anchor? Well, what I want to ask you to do, if you have your Bibles this morning, I want to ask you to turn to the book of Hebrews. You know, the Bible is divided up into two major parts. You have what we call the Old Testament, and there's 39 historical documents that make up the Old Testament. Then we have what's called the New Testament. There's 27 historical documents that make up the New Testament. The book of Hebrews is found in the New Testament. And remember, the New Testament is all the stuff that happened at Christ's birth and his life and his death, his burial, his resurrection, and the beginnings of the church. And everything in the Old Testament is before Jesus. It's kind of easy to remember that way. Well, somewhere near the end of the Old Testament is this book of Hebrews. Now, we don't actually know. We're not told who the author of Hebrews is. But if you were to look at Hebrews as one big chunk, it really is one big sermon. It's less of a letter and more of a sermon. And so we're going to look in Hebrews chapter 10 at just a small section of the sermon that talks about this hope that we have in Christ and how we maintain, how we hold tightly to that hope and to that anchor. So what I want to do right now is I want to pray for us. I want to pray and ask God to help teach us. So maybe you've never prayed before, and you don't have to pray out loud. You can just close your eyes and bow your head. It can be very simple. I'll lead us in a prayer. But we're going to ask God to teach us this morning. As we gather together all over the world in multiple locations watching online, let's pray that God teaches us through His Word how we can be men and women and boys and girls that hold strong to the anchor of Christ in the midst of this storm. Let's pray together. God, I pray that you would teach us, teach us from your word, how do we hold tightly? How do we hold tightly to the hope that we have in Jesus? God, show us from your word how to do that. Lord, teach us, grow us, help us get to know you better so that we can love you more. And God, help us to love one another more, even in this season where we can't even be around each other. God, we love you, and we ask these things in Jesus' name. Amen. So let's start. In Hebrews chapter 10, verse 23, listen what the author of Hebrews says. He says, let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope we affirm. To the hope we affirm. Now, what I do is I pause right there, and in my Bible, I'll underline or even circle that phrase, the hope we affirm, and I ask myself, okay, so what is this hope we affirm? Well, the author of Hebrews, he tells us in a few sentences before, a few verses before, beginning in verse 19. Let me read what he says. He says, And so so dear brothers and sisters we can boldly enter heaven's most holy place is that how you feel like when you think about standing before god do you think about boldly or confidently being able to stand and connect with god and and the author of Hebrews is saying, look, look, look, when you know Christ, you can boldly enter his presence. You can boldly come before him in prayer and in relationship. Why? Watch for the next phrase. Because of the blood of Jesus. What do we know about the blood of Jesus? Go into the next verse, verse 20. He says, by his death, that's the death of Jesus Christ, Jesus has opened a new and life-giving way through the curtain into the holy place. So we got to go back in history a little bit. We got to go back a little bit before Jesus and during his lifetime. The power and the presence of God among the people of God was revealed in the temple of God. And so the holy temple in Jerusalem had multiple rooms and places where the high priests and various priests would come to offer sacrifices and worship. And there was this one room, this one place called the Holy of Holies, or this particular translation calls it the most holy place. And that Holy of Holies was separated by a huge thick curtain and and no one was allowed to go in there except for the high priest and the high priest would go in there only once a year and he would go in he would offer a sacrifice and he would offer a sacrifice for his own personal sin and the sin of the people and what happened was the day that jesus died on the cross that huge curtain that separated everybody except for the high priest from the Holy of Holies, from the power and the presence of God, that curtain tore in half from top to bottom. God tore that curtain at the death of Christ, giving access to anybody and everybody to the Holy of Holies, giving access to anybody and everybody to the Holy of Holies, giving access to anybody and everybody to the power and the presence of God. And so in this scripture, the author of Hebrews is saying, look, Jesus is now that curtain. He is that curtain and his death on the cross gives us access. We go through Christ, faith, trust, hope, belief in Jesus alone. And that's what gives us access, belief in Jesus alone, and that's what gives us access, a new and a life-giving way to the power and the presence of God. We no longer have to be separated from God by anything. Our sin separates us from God because God is a holy God and we are unholy people. But he says now because of the death of Christ, we now have access, a new life, new access to God through Jesus Christ. And he continues on in verse 21. Listen to what he says. And since we have a great high priest, who is the great high priest? It's Jesus. We no longer have a need for any other priest or any other mediator between us and God. Jesus is that mediator. Jesus is that way, that connection between us and God. And he says, we have a great high priest who rules over God's house. connection between us and god and he says we have a great high priest who rules over god's house then watch this he says let us go right into the presence of god with sincere hearts fully trusting him through jesus anyone and everyone can have complete access to god so how do we know this reality he tells us as we continue on verse 22 For our guilty consciences have been what? Sprinkled with Christ's blood to make us clean. Our bodies have been washed with pure water. Notice he says to make us clean. Do you know because of the death of Jesus Christ on the cross, you can be made right. Let me say it another way. You can be made righteous. You can be made holy. So when God looks at you, he actually sees the righteousness of his son, Jesus Christ. That's what happened on the cross. On the cross of Christ, Jesus took on all my sin and all your sin, every word, every action, every disobedience that we have ever thought, said, or done, He took that on Himself. And He paid the ultimate price. And He died for our sins. And then His righteousness, the righteousness of Jesus, the holiness of Jesus, was imputed, it's kind of a big churchy word, or placed upon us. So we know that because of the blood of Christ, we are made clean. We are made right before God. And the author of Hebrews is saying, look, there is this great hope, this great conviction that we have that we can hold tightly to, a hope found only in Christ, a salvation found in only Christ. He says because we need to hold tight and don't waver from this hope we affirm because we know God can be trusted to keep his promise. This is verse 23 in chapter 10 of Hebrews. God can be trusted. He can be trusted to keep his promise. Jesus says, I'll never leave you nor forsake you. This promise of eternal life, this anchor of the hope that we have in the person of christ and the work of christ to make us right to connect us god with god from now to all of eternity that's a hope that we can hold on to regardless of what happens in this life so then the question comes okay so all right so if i'm i'm commanded in this scripture as a follower of jesus told tightly to the hope that I affirm in Christ, this hope of being connected to God through his son, Jesus, and the death of Jesus on the cross. How do I do that? Well, this is where it gets really important because the very next phrase that the author of Hebrews says is we're going to do this and watch this. This is verse 24 in chapter 10. He says, let us think of ways to motivate one another. Another way to translate that is to inspire one another, to encourage one another, to push one another, to propel one another, to stir one another up to what? To acts of love and good works. Love for who? First of all, love for God. Like, let's figure out how we can inspire, motivate, and encourage one another to love God more. It's not just love for God, but it's actually love for one another. How can we help each other love one another? And not just one another, but how can we help each other love our neighbors? Even the people we've never met. I mean, love is a powerful command we see throughout scripture. and we're told here if we're gonna hold tightly, we're gonna hold firm without wavering to the hope that we affirm, to the hope of the person and the work of Christ and what that does in our life, then we got to figure out how to motivate each other to how to love God, love others more and then also to motivate one another to good works, to do good things for God, for his glory, for the glory of God and the blessing of man, to do good things for one another, to do good things for complete strangers, to do good things for our neighbors. So how are we going to do this? How are we going to motivate and inspire and encourage one another to love and good works? The very next verse, verse 25, he says it this way, let us not neglect meeting together as some people do. Now here's the reality. In the first century, there were people that begin to understand who Jesus was, and they actually made commitments, all-in commitments. Say, you know what? I'm all-in. I'm going to follow Jesus with all my heart, mind, soul, and strength. I'm going to love him. I'm going to live for him. And these people begin to try to follow Jesus, God's son, apart from God's people. They thought, you know what? I don't, I mean, I got the Holy Spirit. I don't need other people. And here's the reality. God loves you so much, He wants to give you gifts. Gifts that enable you and enable me and empower us to know and love and follow Jesus more. One of those gifts is His Spirit, God's Spirit. God's Spirit is placed within us the moment we put our faith in Jesus Christ. We are marked with the Holy Spirit. God's Spirit, the same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead, lives inside of you. So therefore, you have complete access to God's power and presence in your life. It's the Spirit of God that actually teaches us and grows us and shapes us to be like Christ in our words and our thoughts and interactions. Now, we don't just have God's Spirit. The second gift that God gives us is His Word. God's Word, the voice of God preserved for us in the pages of the Bible. You realize the Bible was originally written in three languages, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. And scholars have spent hundreds of years in such an amazing work translating these languages into English. In fact, in our culture, man, we have a plethora of resources, a plethora of translations of the English Bible that we can read the English Bible in multiple translations so that we can know what God wants to say to us. So God uses his spirit and his word to grow us, but he also uses the gift of his people. The same spirit that lives inside of you as a follower of Christ, if you've decided to follow Christ, lives in other followers of Jesus. And that spirit uses their words, their actions, their perspective, their gifts to help speak to you and help you grow in your faith. So here's the reality. If you're going to disconnect yourself, and if I'm going to disconnect myself from God's Word and from God's people, then I should expect and anticipate I will never be led by God's Spirit. I don't think it's possible to be led by God's Spirit apart from God's Word and God's people. I don't think it's possible to be led by God's spirit apart from God's word and God's people but yet in the first century and even honestly in our century we try to follow Jesus apart from his word and his people we say man those people they don't I don't need them or or like me I I say that even about God's word and the reason I know that is because there's days of my life that I I spend the whole day and I never one time read the Word of God. In my own pride and selfishness, somehow I've come to the delusional belief that I can follow Jesus apart from hearing from His voice and His Word. And every time I push back away from not only God's Word and God's people, I should anticipate in my life there's no way I'm going to be led by God's Spirit. And the author says here, we can't neglect gathering together because we need one another to grow in our faith. We need one another to motivate one another to love and good works. We need one another if we're gonna have any hope to hold tight to the hope that we have in Christ. If we're gonna hold tight to the anchor in the midst of this storm, friends, we need each other. You may not think it. You may not even believe it. But the reality is, the author of Hebrews says, man, we need it. Apart from each other, we are going to lose our grip on the anchor of Christ in the midst of this storm. And if it's not this storm, it'll be the next storm, the next trial. We need each other. And he goes on and he says, look, some people have the habit of doing this, but we need to not only meet together, but we need to encourage one another. And then he says this phrase, especially now that the day of his, talking about Jesus, especially now that the day of Jesus's return is drawing near. You know, the Bible teaches us that Jesus comes two different times. The first time you're very familiar with, right? This is the time that we celebrate every December, right? This is Christmasmas this is when jesus has come to us in the flesh born of a virgin in a manger right and then we know the stories matthew mark luke and john these are the four gospels are four different perspectives of the life and teachings of christ and his his birth his death burial resurrection all this kind of stuff and we see all these amazing stories of his ministry the things things he said, the things he did, the miraculous things that he did that affirm that he is indeed the son of God. And then his death, then his burial, and then his resurrection, right? And these things help us know who Jesus is. And he came, and the Bible tells us this in the gospels, to seek and to save the lost. He came to to be our savior he came to offer himself as a once for all sacrifice on the cross to pay the penalty of our sin just like the high priest came in and year after year would offer a sacrifice when jesus died on the cross there's no longer a need for a sacrifice in fact later earlier later today sorry if you want to read hebrews chapter 8 9 and 10 all together like you'll see this. You'll see the author of Hebrews, the preacher is telling us, hey, look, that's what the priest used to do, but now that Jesus has come, once for all, that sacrifice has been paid for by the blood of Christ. And so Jesus came to save us from our sins, but then he ascended into heaven, and then Jesus is coming back. No one knows the day or the hour. So if somebody tells you, man, I know the day, I know the hour, man, just be polite to them. Say, hey, thanks for sharing that. But just know they don't know it. There might be some day somebody guesses, right? And it might be one of those guys that every day wakes up and every hour on the hour says, it's this hour, it's this day. And eventually somebody's going to be right, but they don't know it. They're just guessing. No one knows the day or the hour, but the Father. And the Father's going to send the Son back. And here's the deal. The second time Jesus returns, which again is closer today than ever before, the second time He returns, He returns not just as a mighty Savior, but as a mighty judge, judging how we've responded to who Jesus is and what He's done for us. Those who have rejected Christ will actually be judged and will be actually put away from God for all of eternity. Those that have committed their life to Christ and accepted his sacrifice and said, I have faith and hope in who Jesus is, just like Hebrews taught us here, like those people spent all of eternity with Christ. And so he'll be separating those that have accepted or rejected who Jesus is and what he's done for them. And he's coming as a mighty judge and no one knows that time or the hour. Now it's hard because as each day passes by, I think a lot of times we think, I don't know. I mean, many of you, if you grew up in church, I've heard he's coming. I don't know. It doesn't seem like he's coming. And people thought that in the first century. In fact, I want to read to you from 2 Peter 3, 9. It says this, the Lord isn't really being slow about his promise, specifically his promise to return, as some might think. He is actually being patient for your sake, and here's why. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but he wants everyone to repent. That's God's desire. It's his desire for you. It's his desire for everyone you know. It's his desire for the entire world that we would repent. What does that mean? That we would change our heart and our mind and our life. We would turn from our sin, turn from our selfishness, and turn completely putting our faith and hope and belief in Christ alone. This is God's desire. This is why each day that goes by that Jesus doesn't return, that's an act of his grace desiring to draw us to him and to save our souls. Because God's pleasure is not the destruction of man, but the salvation of man. And Hebrews says, look, we've got to continue to inspire one another. We've got to continue to motivate one another, to love God and love others and do good works for the glory of God and the blessing of man. We've got to continue to motivate one another, to love God and love others and do good works for the glory of God and the blessing of God. We've got to do this. We've got to not neglect meeting together because the day of Jesus' return is closer now than ever before. And the closer it gets, the more important it is for us to meet. So if you think about it, he's saying, let's motivate one another. Let's encourage one another. How do we do that? Let's not neglect meeting together. Some have that. Now, here's the deal. Today, we are not only told not to meet together, like this scripture tells us meet together, but yet we are told don't meet together because it's dangerous. So how do we not neglect meeting together when we're told to meet together? Let me rephrase that. How are we going to not neglect meeting together when we're told not even to meet together? Okay. So let's go back to just kind of the highlights of what we're told in this passage. Remember, we're told these four things. Hold tight to the hope, motivate one another, don't neglect meeting together, and encourage one another. These are the kind of the let us statements that we find in these few verses. And again, kind of got to scratch a line through the whole not meeting together because we're actually told not to meet together. So we've got to ask ourselves and we've got to practically apply and say, okay, so then how do we do this? How do we both isolate and motivate in this season? Isolate and motivate. To isolate, here's what we do. We do exactly what the government's recommending we do, okay? We decrease our physical contact with one other, okay? This is the whole social distancing thing. And you might wonder, okay, as a follower of Jesus, like, how should I respond to this social distancing thing? Because, Pastor, you just read to us how important it is to not neglect meeting together, yet we're told not to meet together. So what do I do in this situation? Well, I don't think my advice or counsel is any help to you. I think we go to the Bible. So the Apostle Paul would say, look, when it comes to the recommendations that our governments are giving us, how should we respond? In Romans chapter 13, listen to what the Apostle Paul says. He says, everyone must submit to the governing authorities. Why? Come on, why, Paul? He says, for all authority comes from God, and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God. He goes on, he says, so anyone who rebels against this authority is actually rebelling against what God has instituted, and they will be punished. So here's the reality. Everyone in political office or in a position that's guiding us and directing us on how to respond to this pandemic has actually been placed there by God. And I want you to know, I have complete faith in Him. Maybe I don't have faith in them. I'm not crazy. I know the people that lead us, they're a lot like me. They're imperfect, broken men and women, and they are going to make decisions that are sometimes just wrong, sometimes that are sinful, sometimes they're selfish. And it's not that I trust them, but I do trust Him. If God's put them there, because the same God that put them here in 2020 to help us navigate in this season is the same God that put Pontius Pilate and Herod in their positions in the moment when Jesus was tried and ultimately crucified. The most horrible thing that ever happened in the history of the world is actually the most beautiful thing that's ever happened. The most horrible thing that ever happened in the history of the world is the death of Jesus Christ on the cross. But at the same time, it's the most beautiful thing. So if God can orchestrate and sovereignly control and put people in positions such that he can accomplish his perfect will about placing Christ on the cross to pay the penalty of my sin and your sin and the sin of the world then I trust he's the same God the same yesterday today and forever the same God that is sovereignly controlling and putting people in position so so this is not a limiting our freedom or even a religious liberties type issue this is limiting the exposure that we have to this virus for us personally and the spread even for others so if you ask me what should we do how should we respond i think we do decrease our physical contact with one another just like government saying and if you want to know what you should do for your government officials i think we pray more and honestly obey more. Like pray for them. Men, the decisions that these men and women are having to make in light of all the facts that they're getting every day changing and all these kinds of things, man, we need to be praying for them like never before. And then in a spirit of humility saying, you know what, this is what you're recommending to avoid or curtail the spread of this virus. So I'm just going to obey more. So we do need to isolate. In other words, we need to decrease our physical contact with one another, but we also need to motivate. Like we can't look at the scripture and go, well, we'll just pause on that. Once we're allowed to meet together, no, no, no. We need to motivate. so how do we motivate we may decrease our physical contact with one another but we need to increase our relational connection with one another this is how we motivate we increase our relational connection with one another and I think we do it three ways number one we need to connect more so here's my challenge for you. I want to challenge you this week to take the initiative. Let me say that again. Take the initiative. The Apostle Paul to the church in Philippi, he said this. He said, look, don't look not only to your own interests, in other words, your own wishes, your own wants, your own desires, but look also, consider also the interests of others. What are others thinking? What are others feeling? So here's just a simple challenge. This week, once a day, each day, I want you to pick one person whom you're going to call our video chat. So none of this just text and stuff. Like take the time to actually hear their voice, or if you can through video, see their face, hear their voice, and take 15, maybe 20 see their face, hear their voice and take 15, maybe 20 minutes just to connect with them. You take the initiative. Do not wait for others to call you. And you get one person a day each day. Like here's the crazy thing. We are living in an unprecedented time. And what I mean by this is normally in our culture, we don't have time for each other. Like, let's just be real. We overbook our lives. Most of us are controlled by all this activity we have going on in our calendars. So don't, not just, let's don't just think about school and work. Like think about all the extracurricular activities of your kids or your grandkids. Think about your own personal social activities and hobbies. Think about the travel that's required, not just leisure, but a lot of times work because all these things have been limited now in this season. Like there's not a softball league right now, right? And your job is not asking you to travel right now. All these kinds of things are happening. What you have is a blessing and maybe it's only for a few weeks, but it's that blessing of time. All of a sudden we have time like we've never had before. Time to work on our marriages, time to work on our families, time to connect on our marriages time to work on our families time to connect with our neighbors and again we're gonna decrease physical contact but we're gonna increase relational connection decrease physical contact isolation increase relational connection and that's motivation so we got to connect with it on it the second thing is not only connect more but care more you know that simple, but what are we told to do? Let us consider, let us think about, let us strategize how to motivate one another to love and good works. This is Hebrews 10, 24. Let's think about it. So we need to figure out how to love more and to do more. Love more and do more in light of the limited physical contact we can have. So as you think about it about as you pray about it Figure out okay. How do I love more? How do I do more? How do I care more for my friends and neighbor now? You can't do everything like your friends your neighbors You're you know what even if it's somebody in another state that you're just calling and connecting with Like you're not gonna be able to meet all their needs and that's okay you can't do everything but you can't do something there's some kind of a resource you have maybe that's time maybe that's knowledge maybe that's skills Reese I don't know what it is but there's something you can do and it's simple and I talked about just just two weeks ago you can simply ask when you're on that phone call hey what can I do to help what can I do to to help? And as they're sharing, maybe you're the person that helps network and helps connect them with another person that meets that need, or maybe you yourself are providing that resource and providing that need. So we've gotta connect more, we gotta care more, and then third and final thing, we gotta share more. Share more, what do I mean by this? Well, here's what I want us to do. I want us this week to do everything we can to inspire, motivate, encourage, spur one another to love and good works. And here's how we're going to do it. We're going to use social media. So I want you to post some pictures, some video, even just written stories of ways that you are loving more and doing more for your neighbors, your friends, your family, things that will motivate and inspire us. And then I just want you to hashtag it. Hashtag fear less, love more. One big phrase, like hashtag fear less, love more, right? And we're going to try to create some buzz on social media. And you say, well, now, wait a second, Pastor, that sounds kind of like arrogant. It sounds like I'm kind of propping myself up and look what I'm doing. No, no, no. You're doing it with a goal of inspiring and motivating and encouraging all of us to love more and to do good things for others. In fact, Jesus in his most famous sermon, Sermon on the Mount, listen to what he says. He said, let your good works show for all to see. Why? Why should we do that, Jesus? Why should we post it on social media for others to see the good things that we've done? He says, so that everyone will praise your heavenly Father. More than ever before, a scared world needs a fearless church, a fearless church that is showing what it really looks like to fear less and love more. We need to create a love epidemic, if you will, that people are like, man, why are those people doing that? Why are they taking time out of their busy schedules, which honestly are less busy than ever before, but why are they doing that to call and connect with people, to care for people, and to show their love for people? Well, we're doing it because we're told that we have to continue to motivate one another, to encourage one another to love and good works. Like the other day I was reading in Matthew chapter 4, and it was the temptation of Jesus. You may have not ever heard this before, but right before Jesus' public ministry, he goes out into the wilderness for 40 days and he fasts. In fact, the Bible actually says the Spirit of God led him to the wilderness and actually led him to a position of being tempted by Satan, which led him to a really tough spot. And I started to think about that. I was like, man, so God's Spirit leads the Son of God to a hard place to prepare him for something bigger he has for him. And as I started to think about the idea of a wilderness throughout scripture time and time again whether it's moses or the nation israel god often used the experience of the wilderness to prepare people to prepare people for something bigger in this case he was preparing his son jesus for his public Friends, we are definitely in a season of wilderness. Like this whole coronavirus, even if you're sitting here today and say, man, I'm not really nervous about getting it myself or someone I know getting the coronavirus. I think with each passing day and week, we begin to have more unknowns. And for many of you, and I've talked to you this last couple of weeks, like it's the financial unknowns. It's the school unknowns. And for many of you, and I've talked to you this last couple weeks, it's the financial unknowns. It's the school unknowns. It's the, what is, I kind of got March and what it looks like, but what does your life look like in April? What does my life look like in April? Or for some people, I'm not really worried. What about June? What about the impacts on our economy? Here's what's weird. Let's just, let's just be honest. Every night, if you choose to, you can turn on the news and you know what you're going to find? It's just been this day after day, more cases of coronavirus and more deaths from coronavirus. And honestly, over the last few days and weeks, it's like more things are closed or shut down. And so you're looking at the economic impact, you're looking at all the kind of impact and you're starting to kind of think, I don't know what's going to ultimately happen. And so with that, I think there's this fear that causes us to withdraw. But what if, what if this was not a setback, but a setup? Like, honestly, like what if this whole wilderness experience, this suffering, this trial, this coronavirus, what if this was all about something bigger that God wanted to do in and through your life, in and through your marriage? What if God said, man, you know what? This marriage junk that you're going through, I'm going to put you together in the same house. And you're like, oh no. And God's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This trial, I'm not going to waste it. This wilderness experience, I'm going to use it in your marriage, in your family. What if for our church, What if this whole thing caused people like never before? Because all throughout the history of the world, like God uses some really, really tough stuff to bring people to their needs, to cause people to turn. Remember what we read in 1 Peter, right? Or excuse me, 2 Peter. He says, God desires all people to repent. Like he's waiting, he's doing things. God uses some of the biggest trials, suffering, and pain in your life, in my life, in the life of our culture to turn people to Jesus like never before. What if God was using this whole thing as a setup, not a setback, to change our world? And so friends, if we are going to hold tight to the hope that we affirm, if we're going to hold tight to the anchor, then we got to figure out in the midst of being told to isolate, how do we isolate but motivate? Motivate, inspire, encourage one another to love and good works. Let's do it. I can't wait this week to check out on Facebook as you hashtag fearless, love more, and hear your stories, watch your pictures, see your videos, as we are all used by God to connect more, to care more, and to share more about what God is doing as we inspire one another to love and good works. Let's be the church. Just because we can't be together doesn't mean we can't inspire and motivate one another in bigger ways than ever before. I love you guys, and let me pray for you and your family right now. I wanna challenge you again. Fear less, love more. Let's inspire one another this week. Let me pray for you. Heavenly Father, thank you, God, so much for your word. Thank you so much, God, for revealing us truth that we find in the book of Hebrews. And God, I pray that we would be a church, that we would be fearless this week, and we really would fear less and love more. That we would motivate and encourage one another through our words and through our actions and social media, but also connecting with one another through phone and FaceTime and all this kind of stuff. We care for one another such that we really did motivate one another to love and good works. God, we love you and we pray you help us hold tight to the anchor of the hope that we find only in Christ. We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen."}]}

I assume all you guys have your shopping done a few confident nods of victory going on out there the rest of y'all your pressure level just went up in it got a little stress yeah hopefully you got the house decorated the tree up lights on it Kids are getting ready for Christmas morning. I tell you, whenever I look back to my childhood at this time of year, man, it brings back so many good memories. And it's not really just the opening of the presents. It was the anticipation, putting out the milk and cookies the night before and going to bed and having a hard time going to sleep. It was racing my brother down the stairs to see who would get to the Christmas tree first. It was the smells. Do y'all have Christmas smells. I can still close my eyes today and smell that Hormel Black Label crispy bacon frying up in my mom's frying pan. Some of y'all just smelt it, didn't you? Her homemade cinnamon rolls in the oven. Guys, we didn't need an alarm clock on Christmas morning. Our alarm clock was the air duct. It would suck in all of those delicious aromas and pipe them through the house and then just slam dunk them right on our nasal passages. And we just jumped up. It's Christmas morning. That's what Christmas smells like to me, bacon and cinnamon rolls. that's what Christmas smells like to me, bacon and cinnamon rolls. But guys, I also remember the stockings. You guys do stockings? Are y'all good stocking givers? Man, my bride's family, they do it upright. I mean, I would get, as an adult, I would get better presents in my stocking than anything I ever else got at home. And they were awesome at it. My family, not so much. I always got the same thing every year. My brother and I always got the same thing every year for Christmas. And so this is what was in our stockings every year. A good orange, because nothing says Christmas like an orange. We, of course, we got a candy cane, you know. It may have been a little bit bigger than this, but not much, right? And then we got the greatest candy bar of all time. Can y'all guess this candy bar? It's Caramello, y'all. Rich milk chocolatey goodness with all of that creamy caramel. It was awesome. It was awesome. But there was just, there was so much in here. It's like we always knew it was happening because mom had to fill up the stocking to make it look like we got something good. And, of course, we got some good old tighty-whities. That's what we got for Christmas every year in our stockings. And it's like, oh, you got us again, mom. So this was our gift for Christmas. Guys, I don't really remember the gifts per se. I do remember my father kind of prepping us to kind of lower our expectations. You ever have dads like that? Lower your expectations. You know, he makes sure mom wasn't around. And, hey, boys, come here. Hey, I just want to let you guys know it's going to be a lean Christmas this year. Yeah, I had the same reaction. What is lean Christmas? Have mayonnaise sandwiches? What is lean Christmas? Manet sandwiches? What is lean Christmas? I didn't realize. I mean, he wasn't planning on doing a whole lot, but I don't ever remember being disappointed. I'm sure mom, you know, she kind of trumped the old Scrooge and made sure that we all were taken care of, probably just like in your homes right now. I think dads are just made to be that way. But I do remember, I do remember one Christmas where I got what I wanted. It was, I want to say it was 1975. I was in first or second grade. And I wrote my first ever Christmas wish list, filled it out, sent it to my mom and dad. And I said, this is what I really want. I'm really pursuing these things. And I was so excited and I gave it to my mom and dad. And guys, I hit the mother load that year. I got all three things that I put on my list that Christmas. First one was this. This look familiar to anybody? Woo-woo! Yep. Guys, for y'all that are not in the know, this is a Schwinn Stingray Muscle Coaster Bike, purple, even had the ape hanger handlebars and the banana seat. This was it. This was the bike. This is the bike I learned to ride on. We didn't have training wheels. Training wheels is whenever you got tired of falling over and skinning your knee and you just decide to pedal faster. That's the way I learned to ride a bike. So this was awesome. My brother and I both got one of these and we were so excited. Next gift was this, y'all remember this one? Rock'em, sock'em robots. It was awesome. See, I think my brother and I were 17 months apart. We had a lot of sibling rivalry. I think my dad bought us this to maybe kind of ease a little bit of the tensions. I don't think it worked because I think one of us got hit over the head with it from the other one. And my dad just bought us boxing gloves the next year and said, go at it. I wouldn't suggest that for you guys, but that was my upbringing, right? All right. What about this next one? Y'all recognize this guy? Yeah, no, this is not Ken. Please do not insult me. This is Stretch Armstrong. And he was the man. My brother and I got Stretch Armstrong and we did our derndest to tear this thing up because that's what little boys do. We were born to destroy things. That's just what we do. And man, we got it. I got one here. Stretch Armstrong, man. A lot of you guys right now are smiling right now, I can tell. We did everything we could to tear him up. Couldn't do it. Pliers, we stretched this thing. We put him in a vise. We did everything. We had to resort to just going to the kitchen, getting a snake mean, we stretched this thing. We put him in a vice. We did everything. We had to resort to just going to the kitchen, getting a snake knife, and just stabbing him to death. I know some of you did it too. You had to see the ooze inside. How does he keep stretching? Well, guys, if y'all don't mind, if y'all would just kind of humor me a little bit, I want to relive some of my childhood memories and see if we can't tear this thing up. Can I get a volunteer from the, there you go. This is awesome. And you're so quick. It's like it was planned. So Levi, we're going to try this. We were unsuccessful in the first service. We're going to do it this time, though, right? I don't think so. Okay. Well, we're going to try anyway. All right, so you grab him here, and let's go. Let's keep going. Payback was coming I know I got him in the first service good job brother hey y'all give him a hand hey before you go I've got a great stocking gift for you thank you let me know how those tighty watties fit. I've got the receipts. If you need to upgrade to some underoos or Spider-Man, we'll make that happen. Thank you. Thank you, Levi. Oh, wasn't that fun? I just love to laugh. That makes me happy. And I was so happy in 1975 when I got all those things. I was so happy. My brothers and I played with these toys, and we had so much fun, but it didn't last, right? It didn't take too long for the novelty to wear off, and I'm sure I began looking for the next thing to make me happy. I'm sure I began looking for the next thing to make me happy. And as I grew up, I continued to chase those things to make me happy. And it was always this roller coaster, fleeting. I got to high school, had a girlfriend. Yes, I did. I know it's hard to believe now, but I did have hair. And we were promised. You all know what promised is, right? Kind of in between boyfriend, girlfriend, and engaged. We had a jewelry class. I made her a ring. Pretty romantic, I must say. Man, we were happy. We're gonna get married. And then she broke my heart. Oh, I was devastated. From the peak of happiness to the lows of lows. Y'all know what it's like for that first time to get your heart broken. Man, praise God that happened or I wouldn't be with my bride today of 33 years, two kids and two granddaughters. Amen. Praise God that I did not get that which I pursued at the time. Got married, had kids, started working my way up the corporate ladder. That was my new pinnacle that I was reaching. I thought, if I could reach the top of the corporate ladder, I'd be somebody. I'd be happy. And I did well early on in my career, got several promotions. And I did well early on in my career, got several promotions, but I finally reached that glass ceiling that I wasn't going to go any further unless I had a master's. If I wanted to reach that executive level of leadership, I had to have a master's. There's only one problem. I hated school. I mean mean I just didn't like it When I walked across the first time I said I'm never stepping foot on a university again And here I am in the late 40s Going back to school to get my MBA I finally get it Excited I'm like alright here it goes I'm about to start pursuing this career of breaking that glass ceiling. And a few months later, I get a call from Chris Williams saying something about God's calling me to Ohio to be a family pastor. Wasn't quite what I was expecting. wasn't quite what I was expecting. And guys, let me tell you, while I was ultimately really excited about coming here, if I'm being honest, initially I was a little let down. I'd done all of these things to pursue this dream and I felt like it was all for nothing. Anybody ever happen to anybody here? I was so frustrated. But we have all of these different things that we're pursuing in life, trying to pursue happiness. Well, today we are continuing this sermon series of Christmas carols. Last week, Matt brought a fantastic message from O Come, O Come, Emmanuel. If y'all missed it, I encourage you to go watch it. This morning, we're going to continue that. I got so lucky. I drew the most popular Christmas carol in the 20th century. It was written over 300 years ago by the Bob Dylan of his age. For all of you Gen Z-ers, That's Taylor Swift to you, okay? Stick with me. Stick with me. He was a pastor. He was a poet. And in fact, this whole carol was penned after Psalm 98. What's ironic is Psalm 98 has nothing to do with Christmas whatsoever. It's a prophetic poem about the second coming. And it wasn't even put to music till 120 years later. Any guesses as to what song this is? Anybody hear me? Joy to the world. Joy to the world. Joy to the world. Joy to the world. It's interesting that we rarely do we truly reflect on the meaning of the songs that we sing, much less worship songs or Christmas carols. So today I'd like us to do a little bit of reflecting. I'd like to kind of compare the lyrics from Joy to the World against the psalm that it was penned after. And then afterwards I want us to go back and revisit this idea of happiness. And since we're in Joy to the World, is happiness and joy, are they interchangeable? Do they mean the same? We're gonna look at that here in a little bit. But as we unpack these lyrics, joy to the world, I want you guys to be looking for the source of this joy. If we're singing joy to the world, let's see if we can't find the source of that through these lyrics. We're going to start in the second stanza here. Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns. His right hand and His holy arm have worked out salvation for him. The Lord has made his salvation known, and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. Church, do you know your Savior? Have you accepted Jesus as your Savior? You walk into a church like this, you assume everybody has accepted Christ. I don't necessarily believe that's true. I think there's some people in here that have never really fully accepted Jesus as their Savior. Maybe you just happened to walk in today, saw a cool name, Fearless Church church and decided to check it out maybe you've been looking for that kind of happiness pursuing happiness pursuing that joy and you've never found it your life and you're like I want some of that today's a good day to receiving so our first source of joy is Savior. Let's look for another one here. Joy to the world, the Lord has come. Let earth receive her king. Shout for joy before the Lord, the king. So not only must Jesus be your Savior, he also needs to be your Lord and king. So this first one's a little bit easier to dive into. Savior, we all want a little piece of that, don't we? Nobody wants to be condemned to eternal damnation. I'll take all of the Savior I can get, just staff that bag full. You start getting into Lord King, that seems a little bit pushy. Don't really know if I want that part of the bargain. Hey, as long, I'll tell you what though, as long as his will kind of lines up with my will, we'll see if we can't work this thing out and we start kind of figuring whether or not we want the full package or just the Savior piece. All right, let's move on. He rules or judges the world with truth and grace, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples with equity. this is a little bit more different so we've got Savior we've got Lord and King and now you're bringing on this whole judge thing that doesn't really sit too well especially with the American public because we don't like being judged Dewey don't like being judged in fact we probably have it wrong most of the time. Most of the time it's really not being judged. It's people holding other people accountable, which really is a biblical virtue. We don't like it. What is it we say? We say, don't judge me, only God can judge me do you really believe that is that something that you really want because I'll tell you it's the only one out of all three of these it's non-negotiable it doesn't matter whether you want him as your Savior or your king you will get him as a judge someday because he is coming back. He is coming back to judge this world. Every knee will bow. Every tongue will confess. And guys, as we look at the whole of Psalm 98, it points to the source of joy. It's these three. It's why we worship. And you may ask, why does all of this matter? Because the book of Psalms is the first worship hymnal out there. Songs of worship. Take a look. Let all their songs employ. Sing to the Lord a new song. Burst into jubilant song with music. Make music to the Lord with a harp and the sound of singing. We even take it a little step further and we say, hey, not only just us, we're going to say heaven and nature sing. Fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains repeat the sounding joy. We go to Psalm 98. It says, even the seas resound, the rivers clap their hands, the mountains sing together with joy. Guys, all of creation worships. It's not just people. And I'm not trying to get all mystical on you here, but if you ever stop to look at a sunrise in the morning, you have those faint clouds and you just get those little hints of pink and purple hues. It's one of the most majestic things that I've seen. I always used to think I was clever. I'd take a picture of it, put it on Facebook, and say, is God just showing off? Thought I was real cute and clever. I don't know if it's God showing off or it's just heaven and nature singing. His glory is so awesome. It's not just limited to us. His creation worships him. So where does that leave us? How does us all conflict with pursuing happiness? Does it conflict? See, this whole idea of happiness is not something new. We've been pursuing it for thousands of years. In fact, so much so here in America, we put it in our constitution. It's one of our inalienable rights. Along with life and liberty, we have the pursuit of happiness. Notice I said pursuit of happiness. Even the government can't guarantee that. Although they'd probably try. There's no guarantee of happiness. But we want it. So much so we even made a movie of it. Purs guarantee of happiness, but we want it. So much so, we even made a movie of it, Pursuit of Happiness. You know the ironic thing about that movie? That was the most depressing movie I've ever seen in my life. There's nothing happy about that at all. Pursuit of happiness. In fact, if you ask people what they really want in life, most people just tell you, I just want to be happy. I just want to be happy. I want my kids to be happy. Well, don't you have any goals for your kids or whatever? Oh, yeah, I'd be great if they were a lawyer, doctor, or something, but at the end of the day, I just want my kids to be happy. What is that? What is this happiness versus joy? Is it the same thing? Is happiness even achievable? And if so, how? So, if we're going to compare these two, we really need to go, kind of go back and ask the question, what is joy? Well well i found a couple of pastors that i that i'd love to share with you guys their thoughts on joy i thought they were really really good first ones from the late oswald chambers he wrote joy means the perfect fulfillment of that for which i was created and reborn not the successful doing of a thing man did y'all catch that that is deep not the successful doing of a thing. Man, did y'all catch that? That is deep. Pastor Jim Cain says this, that joy is when your whole being sings because you have caught a glimpse of God at work. Not your typical thing that you turn to when you're talking about happiness, is it? So let's do this. Let's compare these two. We have happiness on the left, joy on the right. First one here is happiness is, happiness is dependent upon our surroundings. Okay? It's dependent about what's going on around us. Joy, however, is dependent upon a relationship with christ plain and simple happiness it's always revolved around what we achieve it's dependent on what you achieve cool thing about joy it's a gift given and received check this out, guys. This is not something that you can take credit for. Not something you can take credit for. It's not something that can be manufactured like your Instagram page when you're taking the selfie and showing the world how awesome your world is. You can't manufacture joy. You can't manipulate it. It's a gift given and received. In fact, joy is one of the fruits of the Spirit. That's a gift from the Holy Spirit. Let's look at the next one. See, a person pursues happiness but reflects joy. That's a big one, guys. Happiness is almost impossible to capture, and even if you do, it's like the grains of sand sifting through your fingers the harder you try to grip it. Happiness is an outward pleasure, while joy is an inner peace. It gives you inner peace. outward pleasure, while joy is an inner peace. It gives you inner peace. What's awesome about joy, guys, is that it endures hardship and trials. It connects the meaning and purpose. Joy transcends our circumstances. It's not dependent on anything that's going on in your world. Church, do you have peace? Or does it constantly elude you? Because I'll tell you, happiness is the most elusive of all the emotions. While joy is eternal. What about you? What's on your wish list this year? What are you pursuing? Levi was in here a little bit ago. He just turned 16. He's looking for that first car. Y'all remember that, right? Teenager's a little bit different now. Whenever I was 16 and getting my first car it was like get me that car so I can get away from the rest of my family give me some independence and it was a pursuit and we knew that if we finally got that first car, we would be happy. What about you? Is it your first house? For all of you guys that are living in an apartment and your neighbors above you have Rottweilers and a wood floor. Man, if I could just get out of here. I want my own place. I want to start investing in the place that I live in. I don't want to live in an apartment anymore. For some of you, it might be a baby. Man, if I could just have a baby, I know I'd be happy. So many things going on in my life. I know that'll make me happy. For some of you guys, you're in a dead-end job and you're not getting along with your boss and you're like, if I could just get a new job, I know I'd be happy. Any of you guys think any of these things? Can I tell you there's nothing wrong with pursuing happiness? Did you know that even happiness is a gift from God, just like joy is? Consuing happiness. Did you know that even happiness is a gift from God? Just like joy is. So I'm not against happiness, I'm not demonizing it. But can I tell you, it's a pale substitute to the real thing. It doesn't last forever. And it can sometimes lead us to be very very selfish and sometimes it can lead us to a position where we've made that thing that we're pursuing an idol and if you're asking how do I know if I've made this pursuit of mine an idol I'll tell you this if it's been something that you've been pursuing and haven't grasped it yet and you find yourself anxious and depressed because you can't find it it might be a pretty good signal that it's become an idol. There's nothing wrong with pursuing happiness, guys. It's just a pale substitute. You see, Jesus is the source of our joy. He's our Lord, our Savior, our King, our Judge. And it's unattainable outside of a personal relationship with Christ. Guys, instead of seeking these external things that produce a temporary happiness, what if we just sought an eternal joy that's only found in Christ and Christ alone? Guys, if you're struggling to find true, lasting joy, here's my question to you. Have you accepted Christ, not just as your Savior, but as your Lord and King, as your judge? This is not a decision that you made as a kid. It's not some prayer that you prayed. This is a covenant that you've made with Christ for him to be your savior, your king, your judge. Have you made him that? The Lord of the world will tell us that let every heart prepare him room. Is there room in your heart for Jesus, or is it so stocked full of all of your pursuits in this world? There's no room left for Jesus? Or is it so stocked full of all of your pursuits in this world? There's no room left for Jesus. Okay, so this may not be you. You may be saying, no, pastor, I've got my future locked down. I know. I've accepted Christ as my savior. He's my king, he is my judge. But I got a little problem. Because the way you're expressing joy right there, if I'm being honest, I'm not feeling that. And now you're at a crossroads. Are you telling me, pastor, that I'm not a Christian? No. I'm just wondering if the lack of joy is due to an unattended relationship. Because while your future is guaranteed and nobody can take away your salvation, joy is not. Joy is dependent upon whether or not you are connected to it. i'll tell you that i confess that whenever i'm in a funk and i'll tell you whenever i get into a funk it's uh it's usually because i have expectations that aren't being met i get real irritable. The worries of the world kind of take over, and I just feel overwhelmed. I start thinking about myself instead of other people. It usually feeds on itself until I reach a point of humility and end up returning to God. And I'm not talking about returning to God like Jelly Roll would do. I only talk to God when I need a savior. I'm talking about truly coming back to him. Church, if this is you, I wanna tell you, your joy has not been taken away from you. You've just unplugged yourself from the source. You wanna get it back? Plug in. Strap on. Continue your relationship with Christ. Guys, look at David. Here's what I love about David. He was a man after God's own heart. And he kind of messed up. Got a visit from a prophet by the name of Nathan. So just a little FYI, if you lived back in the days of the Old Testament and. Got a visit from a prophet by the name of Nathan. So just a little FYI, if you live back in the days of the Old Testament and you got a visit from a prophet, it's usually not a good thing. So he wrestled with David for a while. David finally recognizes his sin. He falls on his face flat before God and just in humility begs him, He falls on his face flat before God and just in humility begs him. Begs him to forgive him. He says, restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me. Here's what I love about David. He's so transparent. I love it. Some of us will stand before God and we'll tout all these things. David's saying here, please restore this to me because right now I'm not even willing. I still want to continue this side piece I've got over here. He's honest to God. This is where I am because I know my pattern. I screw up. I feel horrible. I come to you. You forgive me. And then because I don't truly. I screw up, I feel horrible, I come to you, you forgive me. And then because I don't truly have a willing spirit, I do it all over again. God, give me a willing spirit so I can be sustained through this. Guys, not all of the world's pursuits are sinful though. Nothing wrong with pursuing happiness. God wants you to be happy. He blesses us every day. But sometimes we don't achieve that pursuit for a couple different reasons. One, God's protecting you. Praise God who protected me from my high school sweetheart. Some of you guys, it's just not, the timing's not right. You still have some growing to do. And here's the reason that's hardest for all of us to swallow, because God is God and you're not. And there's some things we're not gonna understand until we do get to heaven. And by then we really won't care. The question is, what happiness are you pursuing that's getting in the way of you experiencing pure joy? Has it ultimately caused you anxiety and depression? Because the holiday blues are a real thing. There are more heart attacks in the month of December than any other month of the year. What's on your wish list this Christmas? What would you like to be on that list? If you've never accepted Christ as your Savior, would you like that on there? We'd love to talk with you. We'd love to talk with you. We'd love to pray with you. Maybe you just want a restored relationship with Christ and say, God, I've been unplugged from you for too long. I've been pursuing so many other things, looking for happiness, that I haven't saved room for you in my heart. Can I tell you that when you do that, the joy that will overflow is indescribable. Your attitude will change even in disappointments. Your outlook in life will change. Your worship will change. It says here to be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. Church, my prayer for all of us this Christmas season comes from Paul whenever he's encouraging his fellow Romans. He says this, that may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust him so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. Let's pray. Father, we thank you. We thank you for showing us where true joy comes from. You are the source, nothing else. And just like our salvation, there is nothing we can do to obtain it. It's merely a reflection of you and us. Father, as we're all in here today, I pray that each one of us would do an inventory on ourselves. Where do you line up as priority in our heart? Father, cause us to truly listen to you instead of the world telling us what it takes to be happy god we thank you for those things that that you've given us those worldly present pleasures and father please don't ever let them take priority over you father let our worship today of joy to the world come from a heart of pure gratitude. We truly understand what you've done for us, Father, and what you've saved us from. We thank you, Father. It's in Christ's name we pray, amen. Amen."}]}

We are part of God's mighty multiplication movement, planting churches locally and globally. Why? Because there's still so many people in unreached people groups who have yet to hear the good news of Jesus. Every year my family has prayed and given to the Be More offering because we know that there are billions of people across the globe who have never experienced God's goodness or even heard of the name of Jesus. Right now our lives are crazy busy with kids and work schedules, but this is one way for us to be a part of something so much bigger than us, a way to share His name and love across the world. In 2022, Fearless Church planted for David. Because of your generosity, we've been able to focus all of our efforts on building a movement of missionaries who love their neighbors and make disciples with no financial uncertainties. We believe the seeds we've sown are going to change people's lives and bring those who are far from God near to them. And it's all because of you. We can't thank you enough. Hey, Fearless Church, you are making a difference through your partnership with India Gospel League. You are making it possible for a church to be planted in every village of India through the Adopt-a-Region Project. Over the next five years, you're going to make it possible to plant 360 churches in unreached villages. Thank you for what you're doing. So what can you do? I'd encourage you to pray and ask God what he would have you to do. If you're led to give financially, you can go to befearless.org and click on give. Last year, over $60,000 was raised and every dollar went to multiplying movements. God might even lead you to be part of a future church plant going out from Fearless. Either way, I'm excited to see what God is going to do. Let's be more together. Well, good morning, everybody. How are we doing today? Extra hour of sleep. It's like the middle of the afternoon right now. You're all ready to go. Hey, we are kicking off our Be More offering today. It all starts today. We're going to talk a lot more about the Be More offering throughout the month of November and even into December. But as we kick this off, I feel like I need to make a couple of comments today, specifically to our guests. Because if you're guests or you're newer to Fearless, and again, especially if it's your first day in you may be thinking oh here we go halfway through the service it's just that time the church is about to ask for my money and we know that there are many of you in the room you may have had a bad experience maybe it's been a church in the past that has dealt with money in a in a bad way or maybe asked for it in a different way or maybe it's some other part of your life and you just know everybody wants a part of your pocketbook here there's a couple things i want to clarify to you as we jump into the be more offering and here's the first one we we don't talk a lot about giving around here and if you've been around fearless for a time you already probably know that in fact some of you wonder where we even get our money from like you're wondering if fairies are making it in the back somewhere. We don't take offerings week by week in this service specifically for that reason, because we don't want that to be a stumbling block between people and God. Now, giving is valuable, and we think it's important. In fact, we don't think that God needs anything from us. I mean, it may surprise you. God has plenty. He doesn't need what I have, but God doesn't need something from us. He does want something for us. And so giving actually does something good in our lives. It grows our faith. It builds us in many different ways. So we don't shy away from that, but we don't take offerings in here. What we do have, though, is a very, very generous church. And so if you're newer to Fearless, I guess I'm sort of bragging on our people. And I don't know what people give. I don't know all the names and faces, but I do know this. Many of you sacrificially give. You give over and over. You give without recognition. You find one of the small offering boxes kind of hidden around the building. Many of you have gone online. You take the time and energy to set up an account, and you give online, and you do it faithfully. And I want to tell you this, Fearless Church, because of your consistent giving and the way that you give we don't talk a lot about money but God has supplied more than our need like God gives us the flexibility and the dynamism to do amazing ministry in and around fearless church and in our area so thank you I want to start with that and I want if you're a guest to know that we have those kinds of people in our midst but here's what I really want you to know if you are new here anytime we are up on this stage and we talk about giving or taking a special offering, or if you happen to be in a service where we pass a basket or something like that to collect an offering, it's because that offering is all leaving our building. Anytime we do that and we make a special ask for an offering, it's because we're giving it all away. And we've done that at different times in the past. And in the same as the case with the Be More offering, this is not money that is going to come and kind of work here at Fearless Church. It's not about what's happening on this campus. It's not about the staff here. It's not about the ministry right here. No, all of the money in the Be More offering goes outside these walls to start to multiply what God is doing around our community and around the world. world he said it and you heard it we want to be a church that starts churches that's our desire we don't want to live right here we want to be a church that starts and plants churches locally and globally we've we've started planting churches locally we want to continue to be aggressive in doing that as quickly as we can and we certainly want to chant plant churches out locally around the world and our real heart is to reach unreached people there are people all all over their world, and many of you know this right now, that will wake up today, just like we did, and they have no recognition of the name of Jesus. They have no ability to understand that God, there is a God who loves them so much that he actually sent his son Jesus to reconnect them back with their father. They don't know that, and we want to make that known. And so we partner with groups locally. Again, we partner with groups around the world to plant churches and reach unreached people. In fact, the India Gospel League is a group you might hear more about during this while we talk about Be More. The India Gospel League is an amazing group. It's helping to raise up indigenous pastors in India. And God is doing some amazing work at planting village churches in and around that region. Recently, we had adopted some different villages over there. We finished that, and now we've adopted an entire region. We at Fearless Church, we're partnered with groups of churches in our area, and we've adopted this large region over there. And the goal is that in the next five years, because of our contribution, that they will be able to plant 360 churches in that region alone. And that sounds crazy, but here's the deal. I think God is actually going to do that because he showed what he's doing over there already. Just since we've started this kind of connection in this region, there have been, I forget, I'm going to have to look at the numbers, probably 15 to 25 to 40 churches already planted who are going to be multiplying churches that continue to plant churches. There have been almost 150 new believers for the first time baptized who know the name of Jesus. And again, that is due in part to what you're doing in things like the Be More offering. So as you sit here today and as we launch into this campaign, please know, please know this. We're not just after your money, but your giving, it does make a difference. And so here's what we always challenge our people to do. just want you to connect with God we want you to pray and ask God what do you want me to do and then respond that's really all it is now respond to us just respond to God and so we're gonna start the offering today you can go online to be fearless org you'll see a banner right on there for be more you can check it out you can give if you want to when you want to it will be available for you in the coming months all right ready to jump in today let's jump in i've got a fun question i think it's a fun question this is one of those questions i would i would put up like at the party table or maybe if you have a family around or something like hey i want a soup starter fun conversation what's the best decision i'm struggling i'm on the struggle bus that was not a good decision what's the best decision you ever made I love that question because everybody in the room has made a good decision I hope you made more than one but you've made some good decisions right we've all made decisions that were thrilled about when we look back at it we have all made decisions that have set us up for success some of you have made great decisions in some relationships that have set you up for success some of you have made some great decisions at work some of you make great financial decisions the range is big all of us all of us at some point another can say i'm sure glad i did that we all have the i'm sure glad i did decision moments that's fun to think about but you know it's not fun to think about the I sure wish I hadn't decision moments and so if you want to kind of sour the room then you ask this question right what is the worst decision you ever made the truth is we've all made some good decisions everybody in the room has probably made some bad decisions. We all have decisions that we regret. Maybe we lament. We've got some decisions we may be downright ashamed of, choices that did not press us forward. In fact, decisions that set us back. The reality is this, and you all know this to be true. You know this to be true, that so much of our lives are actually just the product of the decisions that we make. Our lives are constantly influenced by decisions that you and I make. And yes, there are things that happen to us, that just happen to us, that we have no control over, but for the most part, our lives reflect our choices. Our relationships reflect our choices. Again, where we are in our work worlds and in our careers they're reflections of our choices so many times where our families are and how we're interacting with kids all of these things are a reflection of our choices decisions constantly set the tone and the nature of our lives and i think all of us all of us want to be great decision makers i don't think i know anyone who would rather lay their head down at night thinking I made more of the I wish I hadn't decisions than I sure wish I had decisions. Every day we face dozens of decisions. Every now and then though, we press up against even a bigger decision. I'll call those kind of those pivotal moment decisions. And you know what I'm talking about. Those decisions that just loom larger, they carry more weight. They're the kind of decision that will set the course or the trajectory of your life for a long period of time. And some of you right now, you're facing that right now. You're in a pivotal moment decision phase of your life. I'm looking around, I see students in the room, and I know students, you're looking, you're saying, man, I'm about to graduate, or I'm about to press forward, and I'm trying to figure out what's next. That is a big decision. Some of you are in a dating relationship, and you've been in it for a time right now, and you're about to make a very big decision about what to do with it. Some of you are making financial decisions. Maybe you're choosing for the first time to buy a house. Scared to death. That pivotal decision. Some of scared to death that pivotal decision some of you are looking at a job change maybe you're thinking is it too late to start a new career some of you maybe you're looking at uprooting your family maybe you're thinking do I need to sell my house and move and I have to start over somewhere those kinds of mega decisions and those decisions are not even just about you anymore are they you've got people in your life you've got kids in your life and so your pivotal decision becomes their pivotal decision some of you are dealing with aging parents i hear that a lot and at one point what was their decision is now your decision and you're having to make pivotal decisions for someone else decisions that affect much more than you maybe it's retirement any number of things on the horizon can become a pivotal moment decision. And I know that when it comes to those, no one wants to misstep, right? Like no one wants to misstep when it comes to the big decisions in life. But the truth is no one wants to misstep when it comes to just the everyday moments of life. We want to know that we're walking in the right direction. So if you've ever found yourself kind of in that big moment or a small moment you're saying i want to make sure i'm going in the right direction i'm glad you're here today i'm glad you're here today because that is the subject we're tackling how do we make better decisions and we're jumping back into this series right here called the movement in fact today is kind of the of the start of a third installment of this. We've been in this series for quite a while, and here's what we've been doing. If you're newer to Fearless Church, I'll catch you up real quick. We are studying this mighty multiplication movement of God according to the book of Acts. God started a mighty multiplication movement many years ago, and it got recorded to us in this book of Acts. The book of Acts is a historical document that's contained within the New Testament portion of your Bible was written by a guy named Luke Luke is one of the four Gospel writers right Matthew Mark Luke and John and Luke was actually a doctor he was a physician kind of a detail-oriented guy sort of a historian he recorded a lot of the things that Jesus did including his death and burial and resurrection. But as Jesus leaves the earth, we pick up into a second portion of Luke's writing. He writes the book of Acts. And we started to look at this movement, the movement. And in its earliest formation, God was clearly on the move. It's a bunch of people that start gathering together, they get on board, and they form something called the church. And we are actually part of that same church today. We sit here today not talking about some distant movement. We are actually part of that movement. And as we've walked through this week after week, we see that God was doing something that truly would be unstoppable. There are a lot of reasons why the movement should have died, but God continued to build into this unstoppable movement. The last two weeks, we talked about two central characters in this middle of the book of Acts. We talked about Stephen. Stephen was a martyr. He was the first guy that was ever truly killed for his faith in Jesus. Last week, we talked about a guy named Saul. Saul has become famous to us. Saul actually had his name changed to Paul. He's the apostle Paul. But Paul at one time oversaw the murder of Stephen. Paul was a murderer and a persecutor of the early church, but he encountered Jesus in a life-changing way, and it truly changed his life forever. It's all part of that movement. And today we jump back into Acts. We're actually going to be in chapter 13. And so if you want want to follow along you can pull it out on your phone you can you can open up your bible we'll have everything on the screen up here for you but we pick up the story story in the early church after paul's great conversion and we find that the church is standing at a crossroads moment the church is at a crossroads moment. In other words, they're at a pivot point. They're at a pivot point. The movement had started among Judas followers of Jesus. And so you have all these Jews who started to adopt the fact that Jesus was actually the Messiah. And so they had all their Jewish heritage, but they're like, no, Jesus is the Messiah. But as that movement started to grow, all of a sudden the Gentiles got on board and god made it accessible and he told those leaders of the church it's not just for the jews it's for the gentiles the gentiles were the ones who felt far from god distant from god and they're realizing for the first time that god is actually not that far away and they got invited to the party and they didn't have to earn their place in that kingdom in the way that they thought they once did. And so the Gentiles, they're really just like us today. They're invited into this relationship with Jesus. And so the movement finds itself at a pivot point. They had a decision to make. How are we going to expand our reach, not just to the Jews, but to the Gentiles? In other words, how are we going to take this message of Jesus truly out to the ends of the earth? And that how are we going to take this message of Jesus truly out to the ends of the earth? And that's where we pick up the story in Acts 13. They're at this moment of decision. And Luke tells us about the church in Antioch. He says there's a church in Antioch. They were gathered there. He mentioned some of the prophets and teachers. He tells us about Barnabas. He says Simeon was there, a guy named Lucius. There's a guy named Manan. And then he mentions Saul. Again, Saul who became the apostle Paul. They're all gathered there. And it says, while they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them. So after they had fasted and praised, it said they placed their hands on them and he sent them off. And it in praise it said they placed their hands on them and he sent them off and the two of them sent on their way by the holy spirit went down to seleucia and sailed from there to cyprus i pause here for a moment because this this introduction to kind of acts 13 it would be easy to read over these few sentences and it is just a few and think this is just another historical note provided by luke That's what it feels like. But the truth is this, what records here is a watershed moment that actually changed the course of history. This is a decision that those leaders one day would have to look back on and say, boy, I'm sure glad we did that. Or man, I sure wish we hadn't done that. Like that was what was in view for them. And we get the hindsight of for them and we get the hindsight of the moment we get the hindsight of the moment and there was a choice that had to be made and they made a decision what did they do they launched the first ever missionary journey of the church that's what's happening right here this is the first ever recorded sending out of people to go and take the gospel to the world and they chose a small group to go and do it to a different region to different people they made a bold choice it was really a bold choice they stepped out in faith in a big way and they made that choice at a critical juncture turned out to be the right choice and as we observe that moment i think we should ask the question what went into that decision what went into that the early church had to make these kinds of decisions what went into the church making a decision of that magnitude now the early church would probably say well the holy spirit told us to the holy spirit told us to mention that twice here and i'm not sure that the Holy Spirit verbally spoke. I'm not saying he didn't. My guess is he actually didn't. My guess is that early church would say, we feel so connected with God in such a way that this Holy Spirit we've been seeing, it feels like he literally spoke to us. He said, this is what I want you to do. Even later, they said, it's not that we sent these people out they were sent out by the holy spirit we've talked a lot about the holy spirit in this series the holy spirit was instrumental in starting the early church that third person of the trinity that god sent to indwell his people the holy spirit came in power and the holy spirit came almost in a demonstrative way in an unexpected way did powerful things did miracles but as we see that early church movement move forward, here's what we see. That for them, it was not just about the power, and it was not just about the craziness of the Holy Spirit. No, the Holy Spirit for them became a guide. Became a daily, moment-by-moment guide that would lead them in the process of making their decisions. You see, that early church, they firmly believed the Holy Spirit was the one that would offer them the direction in key decision-making moments. And I think God still wants to do that today. I think God still wants to do that today. I think God wants to give you direction. He wants to give me direction. God wants to give us direction through the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is alive and well, and God wants to give us direction through the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is alive and well, and God wants to speak to us through Him. And if we're going to be better decision makers, we have to pay attention to that. We need to dial in and tune in to the Holy Spirit. They made room for the Holy Spirit to inform their choices. That was what was so amazing about this early church movement. They dialed in, they leaned in in such a way that they felt like the holy spirit was speaking to them and so can we and so today we're going to talk about just a couple of habits of that early church there were some things we see in that early movement that we would do well to emulate things that we can kind of fabricate our lives after that would put us in a better position to truly hear from the Holy Spirit. Here's one of the habits of the early church. Good decision makers, they get and stay connected with God. That's the truth. Good decision makers, they get and they stay connected with God. From the smallest everyday choices to those important kind of pivotal moment decisions, we would all be better decision makers if this happened, if we were able to get connected and if we stayed connected with God. And I feel like this seems obvious. Some of you are thinking, well, no kidding, right? But when we're making decisions, especially some of those bigger decisions that take up a lot of bandwidth, it's not always a natural go for us to stay focused in on God and who he is it sounds strange right we get caught focusing our attention on the decisions at hand some of you have had this you get caught in a relationship right and you've got to make some significant decisions about a relationship guess who you're focused on that relationship you've got some stuff going on at work guess what you're focused on making decisions about work or that co-worker or maybe that workload or time schedules if you have a financial situation coming up and it's looming large and you've got a decision to make your head gets caught into the to the spreadsheets and the paperwork and the banks and the dollars and cents we've got families we got so much going on that our heads get caught dealing with our kids and dealing with decisions about education all these other things in other words when a decision needs to be made, it's so easy and natural to start processing the decision without letting God into the process. And I'm guilty of this. I mean, this is sort of my, this is kind of my deal. I'm just airing my laundry. That's kind of my deal. I sometimes, I will go and think about making decisions and then I will check back in with God. It's not that I don't want his input, but I'll check back in with him when what? When I've kind of come to the end of my resource. Or I'll check back with him when I thought the decision I made was going to work. It didn't quite work, and so I'll check back with the God and say, why didn't you make that work? I'm confused. I'll go one step further and I've gone and made decisions that I think are good decisions then I will check back in with God because I'm really hoping he'll just kind of pat me on the head and affirm me and say you're right that was a great call I mean do you ever do that we kind of relegate God sort of to into an outsider we don't necessarily intend to do it it's just that he kind of gets pushed aside but he's not in the middle of the process and so as we look at decision making we need to get and stay connected with god because he is actually the one that holy spirit is the one who wants to be in the middle of the process not checked in with he wants to be in the middle of the process day by day moment by moment in real time as we make our decisions and so the early church made it a habit they kind of clung to each other but more than that they clung they clung to god they had habits of where they would get and stay connected with god we see it very early on we talked about this back in our series way back when it started when that early church gathered they continued to gather in a large group setting as more people came let's get together we're going to spend time together for teaching and we're going to get together for encouragement we're going to get together to challenge each other and be around the things of god but not only did they gather in these large group settings they immediately started to gather in homes home to home side by side with each other they learned to practice their faith so that it never got too far away from them so that it wasn't something they checked in with on occasion they lived in people's lives practiced their faith one to another on top of that they had these personal spiritual practices that they would do so that they in and of themselves would connect with god connect with jesus in a real way and when we see that we see it evidenced in acts 13 even as this church in Antioch, again, had been gathering, they remained in the midst of gathering. It says, while they were worshiping, they were gathering together as a group. But not only that, they were praying. It says they were fasting. There were certain spiritual practice they were participatory in. Why? Because they set aside specific intentional time so that they could better hear the voice of the holy spirit and i think they really believed they wanted to hear from the holy spirit so that they would make a better decision and those spiritual activities that they gave themselves to they were not a religious formula i don't think for them i don't think it was some special religious formula i don't think that early church gathered because it was all about keeping up tradition they didn't gather like this for the sake of tradition they gathered for the sake of change they gathered together with other people because they wanted to make sure that they were conforming themselves individually collectively they wanted to conform themselves more and more to who God was. They participated in that stuff so that they could grow into the type of person that Jesus was. And you remember at that time, like Jesus for them was not a distant memory. Like Jesus was in their midst, some of them face to face, but certainly in a very relative past, they knew what this guy looked like. And so they wanted to conform their self to say, I want to be more like that guy you see they knew back then what we still know now who we spend time with influences us we know that right who we spend the time with actually influences us parents in the room you certainly know it parents in the room get real spun up about who their kids spend time with. And rightfully so. You know why? Because we know that our kids' friends influence our kids. Right? And we want our kids to be around other good kids because we want them to influence well because otherwise our kids might start making poor decisions. And we want our kids to be great friends because we want our kids to influence others well and help them make better decisions. Who we spend time with matters. We can form more and more to the people around us, more and more to the places we spend time in. And it might seem obvious, it might seem obvious, but here's the point. The more we get connected with God, the more we're staying connected with God, the more we will start to make decisions influenced by Him that are in line with who he is. There is a correlation between our connection with God and our ability to hear from and kind of get that direction from the Holy Spirit. The Apostle Paul, he goes out later, he writes a letter to the church in Rome, and this is what he says, very much the same thing. He says, now don't conform to the pattern of the world. In other words, don't just conform to whatever you find out there. He says, no, you need to be transformed. You need to be transformed. You need to be changed. You need to be renewed. And he's really speaking about the whole of who we are. He says, you need to be renewed in your mind but it's not just an intellectual exercise paul's not saying go and just learn more although learning is important it's not just about knowledge although knowledge is important paul is not saying just go accumulate knowledge no he says the decisions you're going to make are made on far more than knowledge and you and i know this right if we just made our decisions based on the things we know to be true, man, we would be some great decision makers. But it's not just about that. We make decisions based on our ambitions and our emotions and our passions, our experiences, the background that we've got, the upbringings we were given, like it or not. All of these things go into the stew that are involved in us making choices. And so when he says, don't conform to the pattern of all of that be transformed by the renewing of your mind he's saying transform all of who you are your mind and your heart transform your ambitions and your passions and your desires in the way that God would have his desires to work and as we get conformed more and more and as we're transformed more and more he says then then you'll be able to test and approve what God's will is. You'll be in a much better position to hear what it is that God wants to say. And God's will, God's will is what? It's good. It's pleasing. He says it's perfect. Does that not sound like the kind of decisions that we wish we would make every time listen getting and staying connected with god it's a habit it's a habit but as a good decision maker you need to get and stay connected with god in such a way that we become more like him because as we start to conform more and more to who god is our decisions will more naturally mimic his we will without even necessarily knowing what's happening we will start to tap into the holy spirit who will be the one speaking through us as we display god in the world listen those earliest church followers they had to make some pivotal decisions we all have to make some pivotal decisions and we would do well we would do well to jump in on this habit to get and stay connected with God but here's a second habit second habit for you good decision makers good decision makers get and stay connected with others they don't just stay connected with God good decision makers get and stay connected with others why because the best decision makers they don't make decisions alone they don't make decisions alone great decision makers always seek out input and they involve other people around them and especially when it comes to big decisions we can't go it alone and you and i need to tap into some of the people around us again we look at acts 13 just that one example again if we're making this principal decision and again luke i don't know i don't know if this is true specifically but luke records hey there are four or five people in the room specifically making this decision i don't think that's an accident why because in a huge moment of decision like that that decision was not made in a vacuum it was made in a group there were multiple people involved in making a decision of that magnitude the church at antioch was All of these people, and if you were to track and watch how things work in this early church movement, what you would see is decisions are often made in plurality. That's the word, plurality. As they establish elders, as they build the church, as they make decisions for how to govern and manage the church, and adding deacons, all these things that go on in this early church movement. Guess what? go on in this early church movement guess what they're not in a maiden vacuum there's not one person there's not one hierarchical head who is saying this is what we're doing no they work together to hear from the holy spirit listen some of our worst decisions you answer that question what was the worst decision i ever made i have i put money on this one our worst decisions come when we make decisions in isolation when we make alone, they're typically not as good than if we made them together. We become better decision makers when people help us. Solomon was a man of great wisdom. He said, man, the way of fools, it seems right to them, but the wise, what do they do? They listen to advice. And I this he says take good counsel take good counsel and accept correction that's the way to live wisely and well listen we all need some good counsel around us we all need to listen to advice from time to time I remember one of the probably probably one of the biggest decisions of my life that I've ever made is asking my wife to marry me. The biggest decision she ever made was saying yes. I'm glad she did. But I remember back then, I was just finishing college and I didn't really have a clear trajectory on where I was headed or what was next. And I met this girl and I was smitten. Okay. Now for you young people, smitten means I was just, I was really into that. All all right we're on our third date and i thought you know what we should get married that's what i'm thinking because that's a good call right parents are like stop talking just stop talking right our third date and so but but at the time god provided some godly counsel and i had some people in my life i particularly had this one mentor in college he was he was older than me he was he was already married And I had some people in my life. I particularly had this one mentor in college. He was older than me. He was already married. He actually had some kids, but he was spiritually more mature in this and that. I remember sitting down with him and I shared with great joy that I'm really thinking I should get married to this girl I just met a week and a half ago. It wasn't quite that close, but it was close. And he looked at me and he said, is this what God wants or is this what you want? And I said, have you seen her? No, I did. I did. I remember giving the answer. I said, man, she's so pretty, of course. And I said, yeah, and she's super smart and she's super kind and we share all these interests and this and that. And he looked right at me and he said, you walk outside these doors, you walk around this world, you will find a lot of pretty people. You'll find a lot of handsome people. You'll find a lot of smart people, a lot of kind people, a lot of people that will share a lot of interest with you. And he looked at me and he said, why this woman? Why now? It was a hard question. Essentially what he was saying in spiritual language was, you tell me, you tell me why this is God's will for you to make this choice at your time in your life turns out it was a good decision but i didn't make it in a vacuum i'm so glad i didn't because that counsel was invaluable to speak into things like that in our life listen friends don't let friends make big decisions alone they don't they don't you've got to get and stay connected with others and it's hard to do that it's hard to admit that we need the help sometimes we come up against something we really just don't know the right call and it can be humbling sometimes to just say i don't i don't fully know if god is in this or if this is just something i want and i might be lost in the weeds it can be humbling to say that so we need people around us at times that are more mature we need to surround ourselves with people who are more mature spiritually than we are we need to find people who are more mature relationally than we are if you've got something at work man you need people who are more vocationally mature than you are we need people with different experiences different backgrounds different understandings different perspectives you know what we need sometimes? You know what we really need? We need that person who's not emotionally involved in our decision, who can come alongside us and say, are you sure you're seeing this clearly? Because sometimes it's so hard to step back and get clarity about any particular decision. But when they come around and they say, hey, just be patient, slow down, and let's talk about this. And they can help bring perspective to things that we don't always get. Anytime we involve people in our decision-making, it will slow us down. It will slow us down. But not making those decisions in isolation can be so, so valuable. Listen, good decision-makers get and stay connected with others. Here's the thing. I believe this about all of you. I really do. I think you all want to be better decision makers. I absolutely believe that. I think we all want to be people who lay down at night thinking back on the day saying, man, I made more of the I'm sure glad I did decisions than I sure wish I hadn't decisions. And I don't know what you're on the precipice of deciding. I don't know if you're just working through your daily grind or if there's some big pivot moment decision on the horizon for you, but whatever you're doing and wherever you are in your process, here's what I believe, that God wants to nudge you in the right direction. God wants to move you into the right place to hear from the Holy Spirit. I don't think God is trying to trap us. I don't think he is trying to trap us. I don't think he's trying to trick us. I don't think he's baiting you into making bad decisions. I think God wants more than anything for us to hear the voice of God and to step in the directions that he wants for us. And I think he would press all of us to kind of assess our current decision-making habits, if you will, and determine, are there some things that I can do to make myself more available to what God wants to say to me? And I'm going to suggest just two questions, two questions to help you along your journey of kind of figuring this out. And here's the first one. Where or how do I need to connect with God? I think that is a first question that you might want to ask. Where or how, right now in my life, maybe do I need to connect with God? And I, for some of you, it may start there it's like i i'm actually not connected with god maybe that's your starting point even if just saying hey i'm willing to be open to a conversation about that i don't feel connected with god or i felt distance from god for a long time and so your next step might be to do this again like some of you sitting in a room like this and i'm not saying this is the be all end all but sitting in a room like this maybe not our room but some room like this maybe this is your next step saying man i have not been in a gathering where i'm i'm hearing teaching i've not been in a gathering where i'm hearing god's word or i'm spending time with other people in this way to be encouraged and be motivated and be challenged maybe your next step is to just keep doing this and do it more often some of you need to break away and find a smaller pocket of people that you can start to practice your faith with that you can really start to do some life with so that you can say man i need to start building those relationships in my life that really will sharpen my faith that really will speak to me in a different way some of you may need to kind of reignite one of your own spiritual practices maybe something that you used to do that's something that has drifted. Maybe you need to start something you've never done before. I know a lot of people will say, yeah, I used to read. I haven't read in a while. Maybe it's time to pick it back up. I used to pray. I really don't pray at all anymore. Maybe you start by picking that up. Find something. Maybe it is fasting. Crazy, right? That sounds like such a big spiritual word. But maybe it's taking a season to set aside some things that you care about to try to build more time and space so that God can speak to you. Find this particular spiritual practice. Lean into it in a heavier way, in a season of life, especially if you've got a big decision coming. And see if it speaks more to you what God wants to say. So that's a question. Where and how do I need to connect with God? Where and how do I need to connect with others? Where and how do I need to connect with others, right? Phone a friend, right? Who are you going to call? Don't call the Ghostbusters. Call the Holy Ghost. I know, see, I immediately regret that decision. That's one of those I sure wish I hadn't moments, right? Cheesy city, you'll remember it, right? Who's going to help you process your decisions? That thing you're facing right now, the thing that maybe nobody actually knows about. So it's going to be on you. Like, you need to find that person who maybe is more mature spiritually than you are, or find that person that's more mature relationally, or that person that can help you process your emotions in a way that's healthy and right and valuable. Maybe inviting that person in that you know is going to speak something different than what you want to hear, but it's the thing you need to hear. And many times they won't know that unless you make the invitation. People are not going to push their way into your life to engage you in a conversation about your choices. You need to invite that input. And it's not just about knowing the right person. It's about sending the text, making the call, setting up the lunch, grabbing coffee, whatever it is, and saying, hey, help me. Help me hear from God about what he might be saying about this piece of my life. Listen, the early church movement, this movement, man, they had to take the message of Jesus to the ends of the earth they made a huge decision a watershed moment that was just one of them there were many more after that but they built habits into their life that allowed them to hear from the Holy Spirit at critical junctures and we need the Holy Holy Spirit to speak to us at the critical junctures of our life. Listen, the Holy Spirit is alive and well. The Holy Spirit didn't go away when the movement stopped being recorded in the book of Acts. That was not the end of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit today, just like then, still indwells the life of a believer. The Holy Spirit is still in us and it's around us and it wants to help us make better decision God wants to speak to us through that Holy Spirit where do you need to hear from God today right where do you need to hear from him what are you deciding where do you need the confidence to know that God is the one speaking to you and that is such a great feeling when you can stand confident in a decision or in a choice knowing just knowing and when you have that moment you know when you're like no the Holy Spirit is saying this to me like he said the Holy Spirit has said it to me God is saying it man you feel that kind of confidence it changes the way you live out that relationship in your dating in your marriage in your parenting in your dating, in your marriage, in your parenting, in your work world, whatever it is you're dealing with right now, we want clarity from the Holy Spirit. We want to be able to say, I'm sure glad I did. I'm sure glad I did. So it starts on a day like today, conforming ourselves, heart and mind, conforming ourselves more and more to the image of God. Because as we more spend more time there, more spend time with each other, other with God that conformity bleeds over into our ability to hear the will of God is good pleasing and perfect will let me pray for us God we do want your direction we say it today we desperately want your direction God I really do believe that as we make choices that are in line with your will, I think those are good and pleasing and perfect choices. And we admit we don't always get it right. I admit I don't always do that right. So many times I don't. But God, continue to build into us, lead us to be people who are in tune with the Holy Spirit. That we might sense your presence in a fresh way, that we might feel more confidence even to take steps of faith, bold choices, knowing that you're with us and you're speaking into it. So God, for each person in the room today, each person watching online, listening right now, God, would you prompt them to take their next step to become a better and better decision maker for your glory in In Jesus' name, amen. Amen"}]}

Draw inspiration from the themes of reflection, faith, and miracles in the sermon below to craft a similar message for your congregation.\n\nSermon:\n\nFive years ago, in November of 2018, where were you? Reflect on your life and consider the changes that have occurred since then. Some of you may have been in a different stage of life, perhaps in school, single, or without children. Others may have lived in a different city. Today, we will delve into Paul's third missionary journey, as described in Acts 19, 20, and the beginning of 21.\n\nPaul's journey began in Antioch, where he met 12 men and baptized them. This encounter had a profound impact on him, leading him to stay in Ephesus for three years. During this time, unusual miracles took place, such as people being healed through touching Paul's handkerchiefs and aprons. Despite the opposition and challenges he faced, Paul remained faithful and continued to share the message of Jesus.\n\nIn our own lives, we may feel that our daily routines are mundane and lack the excitement of the miracles we read about in the Bible. However, it is important to remember that God is present in our everyday experiences, and our faithfulness in the small things can lead to extraordinary outcomes.\n\nAs you reflect on your own life, consider the following questions: How can you remain faithful in your daily tasks and interactions? How can you share the love and message of Jesus with those around you? And how can you trust in God's plan, even when faced with opposition and challenges?\n\nLet us pray for the strength and courage to remain faithful in the mundane, trusting that God will work miracles through our obedience and dedication to His will. Amen."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Five years ago, November of 2018. Where were you? Where were you five years ago, November of 2018, where were you? Where were you five years ago? You see, some of you high schoolers in the room, you were in elementary school. Some of you were still in high school. Some of you were still in college. Some of you were not married yet. Some of you didn't have children yet. Some of you had children at home, and now they are no longer with you. Some of you didn't even children yet. Some of you had children at home and now they are no longer with you. Some of you didn't even live in Dayton five years ago. Where were you five years ago? You see, we've been in this movement over just the early church and Paul's story. And today we're going to take a look at his third missionary journey, chapters 19, 20 and the beginning of 21 of Acts. And we're going to take a look and it ends with paul in prison it ends with paul in prison but it didn't start there it didn't start there in fact five years ago it started in antioch it started in antioch where he he came and traveled to Ephesus. And in Ephesus, we see a first highlight of his life. You see, if he had a social media presence, he would say something like, hey, just met 12 guys, were baptized. They became prophetic, had a prophetic word, and spoke in tongues. Hashtag bless, right? Get the picture with them. And that made him stop and stay in Ephesus. Stayed in Ephesus for three years. For three years, he just stayed in Ephesus until something unusual started happening. In fact, the Bible says that unusual miracles started happening in Paul's life. You see, Paul was a tent maker, and he would make tents throughout the day, and he'd wear an apron, and he would have a handkerchief that he would wipe his brow with or maybe his hands with. And the handkerchief and the apron, the Bible says, when it touched people, they were immediately healed or the demon-possessed were delivered from the demons. And that's unusual. In fact, it's so unusual that a group of people, see Ephesus was a melting pot of different religions and different backgrounds, different beliefs. And seven brothers thought we could do this. We could do this. And so they went and they found a demon-possessed man and they said, hey, in the name of Jesus, who Paul preaches, be gone from this man. And the demon speaks back to them. And the demon says, we know Jesus and we know Paul, but we don't know who you are. And the demon rips their clothes, beats them up, and if Paul was writing this and posting it, he'd probably do hashtag naked and afraid, right? You're welcome. This caused fear, fear in the city of Ephesus, so much so that they would bring their books that had incantations and spells in to the city square, and they piled them, and the Bible says that they burned them and that it was actually worth over a million dollars. So another hashtag, books a million, right? Thank you. And it's amazing to see what happens, but opposition starts happening because the people that sold those books and sold idols to people that had religious traditions where they would do, use these things, it started hitting their bottom line. It started hitting their profit, and so they took Paul to the city officials and said, this is not good for this city, and Paul left Ephesus after three years. And he traveled to Macedonia, Corinth, and then we get another highlight in his life where he gets to meet with the believers in Troas. And he may post something like about to teach and preach, hashtag pray, right? And he goes to this house that's three stories high and he starts teaching these people. It says around dinner time. As soon as he starts teaching, they start listening and they're engaged and at midnight, at midnight, a guy starts nodding off and he's on the third story in the windowsill and he falls out to his death. That's why we put chairs on the ground here at Fearless. And you see Paul goes down and takes him up in the arms and says, hey, don't worry, he's alive. And a miracle happens. He's raised from the dead and you'd think Paul would be like, let's end on a high note, right? No, he goes back to preaching until morning. So we've got some time, right? I mean, he goes all night long. And then he leaves there and he gets to spend a little more time back in Ephesus with the leaders. And there and he gets to spend a little more time back in Ephesus with the leaders and then he gets to Caesarea and he looks at Caesarea and there's this guy named Philip that he goes to his home and he's an evangelist and evangelist is just someone that brings a message to someone and so he brings a prophetic message to Paul and Philip takes off his belt and takes Paul's hands and wraps them up and says hey if you go to Jerusalem, imprisonment and being bound is what is going to happen. And that prophetic message happened. Maybe Paul would say something like hashtag run the race, right? And you see, this is what happens in Acts 20, 19, 20, and 21. And we get to read these. And if, I don't know if you do this, but when I read chapters in the Bible that have highlights like these things, have miracles like this thing, I look at my life and I'm like, mine's kind of boring. Like maybe you're asking the question like me, God, when are you going to deliver me from a sin that continues to plague me? Or maybe you have a sickness or cancer that you're like, I've been praying for years that God would heal me, and I've not experienced this. Maybe you're like me, and you're praying for one of your children to come to follow Jesus, the Holy Spirit to come in and just connect with them and pull them into his relationship, and you get to celebrate them, but he hasn't happened yet. Maybe you're asking these same questions because our culture loves to celebrate the highlights. Like if you look at anybody's social media, right, you see the weddings, the new car, the new job, the weight loss, you see all of these amazing things and pretty good. We're really great at comparing ourselves. We don't see the post about the part where the family man comes and unclogs the toilet for the third time that day, right? We love to celebrate highlights. We love to watch movies that are amazing. People aren't going to sign up to go watch a mundane, boring movie. You see, we love highlights. And pretty soon, when we compare ourselves to everyone, culture has an answer for that too. If your life is boring, if your marriage is boring, if your job is boring, change it. Get the new car, the new job, the new spouse. Or you swing all the way the other way and you kind of settle. You're like, well, God hasn't moved in five years. What means, why would he move the next five? And we just settle for the mundane life. And pretty soon we read that in scripture too we allow culture to say okay experience highlights and so we start asking well if god isn't moving in my life maybe i should change maybe i should read more pray more study more maybe i should become a pastor go on missions what do i need to do to cause miracles to happen in my life? Or maybe we just settle. God, you're not moving. And pretty soon, we start asking, why? Why, why, why? And I would say Paul gets to talk about some of this. We get to experience Paul's daily life. And because if we were honest with ourselves, if we knew how Paul lived his daily life, maybe we could get a little idea of what to do in our daily life. You see, my daily life looks like I wake up, I get kids up and get going, those that still need my help, and they eat. And I'm constantly saying, have you eaten? Have you gotten dressed? Did you get... All of these things to get them out on the bus on time. And I'm constantly saying, have you eaten? Have you gotten dressed? Did you get? All of these things to get them out on the bus on time. And then I come to work and we work and then I go home and we do homework and we eat and we clean dishes. We talk about highs and lows. We maybe watch a TV show and then I go to sleep and wake up and do it all over again. And maybe you live some of that same mundane life, and you're like asking, God, where are you? What are you doing? And pretty soon, I would say what you need to focus on is what you're doing in the mundane. Because what we do in the mundane matters. Paul says this. Paul does this. We get to see Paul and what he does in the mundane. And honestly, Paul has actions, expectations, and mindsets that if we could take a look at, and we're going to, maybe we can gather some ideas on how to live this life. You see, the very first thing that Paul does is he works. Now, maybe that's not exciting for you. You're like, what? You're kidding me. This is the first one. I got to do that tomorrow. We were actually created to work. You see, at the Garden of Eden, I almost said Gethsemane again. Man, that's Jesus. We're Adam and Eve. We were created to work. Like, before sin entered the world, says work the garden take care of the garden take care of the animals this idea of work was before sin entered the world the lack of desire to work and hard work entered after fall of man but we were created to work you were created to work you see Paul knew this Paul said you know that these hands of mine have worked to supply my own needs and even the needs of those who were with me you see he was a tent maker he woke up every day and he worked and maybe you would say well doesn't jesus say something about god supplying our own needs and yes he does through the ability that he's giving you to work you see he's giving you a job and the ability to go to that job and to work as unto the Lord to earn income and provide for your needs. And so as we talk about this, some of you have that ability. Some of you have that ability to go to work and earn a paycheck. And you need to go and realize God has given that to you and he wants you to work as an example, as an ambassador for him there daily. Some of you stay at home. You have the hardest job on the planet. You're raising children. And it's crazy. It looks like the mundane life. You literally wake up and go, what day is today? Right? You know this. You know this is hard, but God has blessed you with the ability to raise your children, to raise your children to work as unto the Lord, and to honestly like disciple your children along the way. Some of you are in school, and your job is to work diligently unto the Lord. God has placed you in this school, in those classes, with those people, and he wants you to be a representation. He's created us to work, and Paul does this diligently unto the Lord every day. The second thing we see is that he shares. And I say share because some of your translation will say teach. But when we hear the word teach, you're like, I need a degree for that. No, he's just simply sharing what God is doing in his life. You see, Paul left the synagogue over here and he took believers with him. Then he held daily discussions at the lecture hall of Tyranus. This lecture hall at Tyranus was a place where the Greek professors of that day would teach philosophies and maybe history of their town in Ephesus. And they would teach in the morning, then they'd take a lunch break. And then they'd go back and teach again in the afternoon. And Paul, this is what Paul's daily life looked like. He'd wake up, he'd work. And then during lunch break, he would go and sit and have daily discussions with those that were still around. Or maybe the believers that went with him at this great hall. And then when those people came back, he went back and worked more. Then he went home and ate and fell asleep, and he worked every day. Again, he's living this mundane life, but he's having daily discussions. And so where, sorry, that's not the right one. So where in your life do you need to connect with people? Again, if you're at a place of employment, at home or at school, where is God asking you to have daily discussions with those people that he's placed in your life in those areas? Like there's a reason why you are there to share, to talk, to have daily discussions with people. And Paul journaled. We know this because between the time he left Ephesus to Troas, he went to Macedonia. And in Macedonia and in Corinth, what he did is he became a pen pal. He started listening to the Holy Spirit and trying to figure out what he needed to share with his friends in Corinth, and he wrote what today is known as the second book of Corinthians. That we get to read and really digest and understand what Paul was in mind and what the Holy Spirit was giving Paul. And then he goes to Corinth and delivers the the message and we get to see that this letter is from paul a slave to christ jesus chosen by god to be an apostle to send out to preach his good news and we know it as the book of romans today during this five year he wrote the book of romans and he was being diligent to just journal what the holy spirit was telling him to do so i have to to ask you, how diligent are you journaling what Jesus is doing in your life and teaching you? Like maybe you should journal some stuff, take it work with you so that you can share your stories with the coworkers. Being a pen pal today looks completely different than it did when Paul was alive, when we had no technology. What if one morning you wake up, because God's good at this, and you start thinking of somebody? What if you would pin them really quick and send them a text? Hey, God brought you to my mind this morning, I wanna pray for you. If you need prayer, let me know. Let's grab coffee, let's share what God is doing in our lives together. That's being obedient to the Holy Spirit, to journal, to reach out, to write, share what God is doing in your life. And the last thing he did was pray. Oh, there we go, pray. You see, at the end of this discussion with the elders in Ephesus, he said when he finished speaking, he knelt and prayed with them. Like we should be actively having conversation with God daily. Like on the way here, I was having conversation with God. God, be with me. Help me remember the things that you want me to speak. I have conversations with God daily. We should be having conversations with God, but I'm going to challenge you even more more. When are those conversations stop being about you and start being about others? When do you need to pray for others? And when God reminds you of people, are you actively praying for them? I'm gonna take it a step further. How active are you praying with others? How often do we say, hey, I'll pray for you, and then never pray for you? Like, maybe God puts you in the life of other people to actively pray in front with each other. And so how good are we doing that? Those are the four actions we see Paul take on a daily basis. I think if we could do that, then it leads us to expectations we can have, and the expectations aren't miracles. Yes, he believed that miracles would happen. He had faith that miracles would happen, but here's what Paul expected. Heartache. He was meeting with the elders in Ephesus, and he said, remember the three years I was with you. My constant watch and care over you night and day, and my many tears for you. What did he have? Like, why did he have tears for them? Because the early church dealt with stuff that we deal with. They have the same burdens. They have same sin patterns. They dealt with death, divorce, raising children, persecution, loss of job they dealt with all of the stuff that we deal with today and and Paul cried for them he had heartache for them he expected life to experience heartache you're gonna have people that you experience heartache with it's something that we should have expectations of. We aren't voided of that once we start following Jesus. The second thing is opposition. When he was here in Ephesus, it says about that time, serious trouble developed in Ephesus concerning the way. There was direct opposition because there were people that didn't believe like him, worshiped different gods. There's gonna be people in your life that oppose you. We should expect it, it is okay. What do we do? We love people, we pray for them. We still connect with them because God put them in your life for a reason. The third thing is rejection. This is kinda hard for me because I love to be liked by everybody. And I love to have respect from people. And when they reject me, it's hard. But Paul says, expect this. Like, but some become stubborn rejecting his message and publicly speaking against the way. And that wasn't in Ephesus then. That was all the way back over here when he first got here. You see, what had happened was, is he met those 12 believers and went to the synagogue. His people, the Jewish nation that worshiped the God of Israel. And he started sharing about what Jesus was doing in his life. And they rejected him. There are going to be people in your life that reject you. You'll have family members, co-workers, friends. It's something we should expect because Paul expected, Paul knew this was going to happen. And the very last one is trials, and I know this is a horrible list, but at the end of, when he met with the elders in Ephesus over there, they said, hey, don't go to Jerusalem. Don't go to Jerusalem. He says, I don't know what awaits me. I don't know what to expect. I don't know what God's going to do, except I know that I can expect this, that the Holy Spirit tells me in city after city that jail and suffering lie ahead. And there's no dot, dot, dot, and you will be rescued. Can he rescue? Yes, we saw that last week when he was in jail, his second missionary journey, and there was a huge earthquake, and he was released from jail. But he doesn't know that he's going to be released from jail. What we know is that life is going to be hard, and we don't get to escape that. In fact, Jesus says it this way, in this world you will have troubles, but don't worry, I've overcome the world his brother james says count it all joy when you face trials of various kinds trials are going to happen trouble is going to happen expect it because as we go along these expectations we get to experience something different and if i had to end on those expectations i would expect that you would say b, don't ever get on the stage again, right? But Paul had a mindset that I think if we could do the things that Paul did and expect the things that Paul did and had the mindset, that's the key, that's the key that the mundane leads to the miraculous, that the mundane leads to the miraculous, and Paul starts with grace you see he writes this this this letter to the church in Ephesus and says it is by grace you have been saved through faith it is not of yourself it is the gift of God it is by grace. He remembers that, man, the message is that we have no hope without Jesus. And we once realized that we can have hope because of what Jesus did on the cross. And when we enter into that relationship with him, we remember all the time what Christ did for us. And if we can start that day remembering grace, then we can start the day and finish the day giving grace. And we approach grace and he says this to the church in ephesus again and after he meets with him he says now i entrust you to god and i mean technically he could put a period there and it'd be great but he doesn't just in there he says i entrust you to god and the message of his grace that is able to build you up what does does this message do? It encourages you. It strengthens you. It unifies you. It builds you up. We've got to remember, start the day with the grace that we've been given. And as we do that, we get to remember that we've been given an inheritance. One day we will get to stand before Jesus and experience grace in his fullness. We get to, that's what's waiting for us. That's what we sing about. And we get to do it with other people. Those that have been set apart, that have chosen to follow God. We get to experience this. And not only this, Paul starts the day with an idea of generosity, a mindset of generosity. Now, I'm not talking about money here. I'm not talking about money. It may be money, but this is a lifestyle, a mindset of generosity. What does that mean? So Paul goes, and I have been a constant example of you after I worked that you can help those in need by working hard. You should always remember the words of the Lord Jesus. It is more blessed to give than to receive. It may not be income. It may not be income. It may not be money. But you are no longer your own. You've been bought with a price. You are now Jesus'. And so your time, your story, your words, your home, your car, your food, your income is no longer yours. It's his. Your food, your income is no longer yours, it's his. When do you need to go to work, meet with the person that is struggling because it's a coworker and you hear that and you're like, okay, I can buy their lunch and I can give my story. And I can give my time. Maybe it's this next week where you know somebody in your life that's a friend that just moved to Dayton and they have no family here. We're coming up to Thanksgiving and God has blessed you with a home and with food and one extra chair at your table. Maybe, just maybe, you go, I'm gonna live a generous life and come spend time with me. I don't have to give you money, but you can spend time and witness the love, joy, peace, patience, kindness patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self-control through our family like what if that's how you live a generous life paul also starts his day with care as he's talking to the to the elders in ephesus again he says remember these three years I was with you, my constant watch and care over you, night and day. Like this is a daily thing that Paul lived out, was how can I care? How can I be aware? How can I live generously to where I care for others? And our culture doesn't say be generous and care for others. In fact, our culture says, get what you want for yourself and care for yourself. And if we can live a life of generosity and care, that's where God starts performing miracles because he works through that. He's been generous and cares for us. In fact, Paul wrote all the way back over here to the church in Corinth. He says, the God of all comfort comforted you in your affliction so that you can comfort others with the comfort he gave you in any affliction. God wants you to care for others the same way that he cares for you. And the very last thing that we see is an awareness, an awareness. And I'm not talking about a physical awareness. Like, I'll walk through this real quick. I woke up this morning aware that I was tired. And so I started some coffee. And I drank it, and I was aware it was very good. And I was aware it was waking me up. And then I went out to my car to drive here, and I was aware that there was frost on my windshield, right? And we're aware of the things that are going around us that are physical. What we're not aware of is the spiritual. We're not good at realizing, why am I here spiritually? Why am I at my workplace? Why am I at the dinner table? What does God want me to do with his spirit right now and with others? You see, we got to become aware of what God has us, where God has us, and who God has us with so that we can become spiritually aware of what he wants to do in us and through us. And as we do that, we will start experiencing miracles. So five years ago, I'm going to put this down so I don't click a slide. Five years ago, if I gave this message to you yesterday, we had driven to Dayton, Ohio for the very first time in our lives. for the very first time in our lives. We pulled up because Chris Williams said, hey, why don't you come up here and just see what Dayton looks like? Be curious. You see, three months before this, we had just adopted three children. And we could come up and we could pray and connect. This was the first Thanksgiving that I spent without our family. I think they're still bitter about that, but that's okay. And we got to spend our first Thanksgiving with the Williams. We knew four people in Ohio. None of you existed in my life. We came, and we experienced Thanksgiving. We went home, and we started praying. We started praying about moving to Dayton, Ohio. And God used his word through the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus is wrestling with the will of God. You see, I was a campus pastor at a church there where I was doing ministry. I had great relationships there. We had been setting up and tearing down a school for three years, and we just broke ground to start building a building. And in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus wrestled with the will of God. And so God brought to my mind, Brian, what do you fear versus what are you just going to be upset with? And I'm going to be upset with leaving those friendships, leaving my co-workers, and honestly upset that I won't experience the building that honestly we were working really hard at. But I feared, I feared leaving my parents because they just moved two years before that, four houses down, because of the grandkids. Yes, I just made some of you really mad right now. And I feared ruining my kids' lives. And that's the two fears that plagued me. And honestly, to this day, it's still two fears that I wrestle with. And you see, God started working in his spirit through my children. And the three that had a relationship with him at that time shared why they thought we should move to Dayton, Ohio. And my parents started working in them. And my parents shared with me why we should move to Dayton, Ohio. And my parents started working in them, and my parents shared with me why we should move to Dayton, Ohio. She didn't like it. My mom didn't. But she shared with me. And then he started working through his people, my community group, my coworkers. And they started telling me things and giving me advice and what not to do. And then in July of 2009... Oh, no, no., Andy started working through some very unusual things. So we had a call from some pastor in Ohio called the church that had no idea I was considering this. I still think Chris set that up to this day. And then January of 2019, and then January of 2019 on my birthday, you see we had this family that purchased a subscription to a magazine when we adopted, when our family became a full unit at that point and they gave us a magazine subscription and my daughter, my oldest, brought this magazine to my attention on January 20th of 2019 and I opened it up, and it had nothing to do in this world except for Ohio. And so I took a picture of it, sent it to Chris Williams, and said, I think we're in. And then in July of 2019, we packed up eight people and an ungodly amount of pets and drove up here to call Dayton our home. And life hasn't been easy. I wish I could tell you it was rainbows and roses after that, right? But it's not been easy. We've experienced the death in the family where I had to fly back to just be at the funeral of my grandmother. We experienced car wrecks. We've experienced a runaway. We've experienced school decisions. We experienced a little thing called COVID and a pandemic. I don't know if that was ever on anybody's radar. Life hasn't been easy, but it's been worth it because five years ago, five years ago, this used to be a Planet Ford building. And renovations started happening to where we became Fearless Church. And in March of 2020, we were going to open, but we didn't. So we launched online. And some of you are in this room today because of us launching online. And in June of 2020, we launched online. And some of you are in this room today because of us launching online. And in June of 2020, we opened up. And we started things and building ministries to where we've experienced some pretty amazing miracles. But if you've been with us since 2020, then you've been able to experience some of these miracles. Because we've experienced in 2020, let me see if I can find the right ones here. This is a representation of people that have given their life to Christ in 2020 and were baptized. And we know they did because they did it in front of us. We experienced an actual miracle of where people left the pathway of death and became walking the pathway of life with Jesus. And so I'm gonna throw this out in the crowd. So Sam, be careful, I might hit you. Okay, no, shoo. So that's 22 people, 22 miracles in 2020. And in 2021, we experienced another 20 another 20 oh i just kicked it another 20 miracles where i'm gonna throw it right here just in case i hit you watch out okay man i stink at throwing so uh another 20 that's 44 miracles And so in, let me find this one. In 2022, this one's a little long. This one's a little long. This is 42 miracles. I'm gonna throw it this way. And so, yeah, just get ready. So Matt and I stretched this out earlier and it went from here all the way to the back wall there. So that was 42 miracles. We're now up to 86 miracles since we've been here. And now 2023, another 43. I'm going to do it right there again because one of these really do matter to me. One of these were my daughter, my youngest daughter, who five years ago actually wasn't my daughter. You see, if we would be faithful in the mundane, miracles happen. Miracles happen. And if we could take the actions and the expectations and those mindsets, and we are diligent at being faithful with them, what is God going to do in the next five years? In the next ten? What does God want to do in your life? What does God want to do with the people in your life if we're just faithful? Because I still need to experience a miracle in my family one of my sons doesn't follow jesus but you can guarantee that both me and my wife will be faithful faithful to to share what god's doing faithful to continue to work and disciple him faithful to pray and and hopefully journal what's going on in his life and i'm going to attack it with a with a mindset of grace and generosity and care because he matters he matters to a holy god and there are people in your life that matter to God too. What can God do if we are faithful in the mundane? It can lead to miracles. Let's pray. Father, I am thankful that you're always challenging us, not to settle, not to change, but to continue to run this race well. not to change, but to continue to run this race well. God, I know that I don't always do it up to your standard and I am sorry. But God, I pray that you help me to continue to be faithful. God, I thank you for the miracles that we get to really witness and see you reach people from death to life. God, I'm thankful for the one that we celebrated in our family this year. God, I pray that I can celebrate another. God, life is not easy. But I'm glad you're here with us. I'm glad you're here walking with us, keeping us in the palm of your hands. God, I pray for miracles that we can't explain. I pray for miracles that are unusual. And God, continue to change lives because of the people in this room and because you're working in them and through them. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."}]}

And so as I was preparing for this message, one of the things that I wanted to do is I wanted to kind of contextualize for myself that the timeline that these believers have just gone through. the timeline that these believers have just gone through. And so if you've been with us this year, you'll recognize that first, at the beginning of the year, we started in Luke with more than a man and then the upside-down kingdom, exploring the life of Jesus. And this book of Acts is actually written by the same author, Luke, who's now kind of unpacking what it looks like for this church after Jesus's ministry. So I wanted to kind of take a moment and just kind of walk through the timeline that they've experienced. And so it's mostly understood that Jesus is like his teaching ministry covered about a three year period of time. And so his, the start of his ministry about six months, this is when he's baptized by John the Baptist. He has this encounter with the Samaritan woman at the well, and he gathers his disciples and then he starts the process of traveling and teaching. And so that, that, that traveling ministry of his, the traveling rabbi was about two and a half years. He spent about a year and a half in Galilee. And of course, there's additional travel that's recorded during these times, but the bulk of his ministry during this time was in Galilee. Then he moves into Judea, which is south of Galilee, where Jerusalem is. And he spends about nine months there. And then there's three months where he crosses the Jordan. We hear the story of Lazarus and his resurrection during this period of time. A lot of his parables are told here during this three-month period. And all of the while, his disciples are starting to wonder if this is more than just the teacher. We look at it with clarity of who Jesus is, and we see there should have been no reason they were wondering this. This seemed to be pretty obvious at the time. But his ministry kind of ends, and the Gospels spend about 30% of the Gospels is focused on the last 10 days of Jesus' life. And it starts with Palm Sunday. So Palm Sunday is this triumphal entry. As the followers are looking at this as this is the coming Messiah. He's about to take his rightful place. And so he comes riding in on a donkey. There's there's waving of Palm branches. There's celebrating and singing. And by Thursday, he's betrayed by one of their own and arrested by Friday. He's crucified. by one of their own and arrested by Friday. He's crucified. And Saturday, these disciples who thought that the announcement of the Messiah was about to happen, find themselves sitting in silence. Now we look at this on the other side of history and we know that the following Sunday was resurrection Sunday. It was Easter Sunday. And so we see the victory in that. And then as Chris kind of unpacked the last couple of weeks, there's, there's about 40 days that Jesus in his resurrected state spends teaching and instructing the church that exists there. Then he ascends into heaven and there's another 10 day period where there's kind of silence and then 50 days after the resurrection, we have Pentecost. That's what Pentecost stands for 50 days. And so Pentecost comes, the Holy spirit arrives. He's poured out on his people. And then as of last week Chris talked about the the Peters first sermon which resulted in about 3,000 people being converted okay like looking at the timeline that kind of makes sense but I wanted to make it a little bit more personal and so I thought through what would it look like if last week had actually been that that Pentecost moment And I kind of worked backwards from there, those three years. And that would put the start of Jesus's ministry at about August of 2020. And again, this is just hypothetical, but what, what stands out to me about that is that the entirety of Jesus's ministry, what we've spent the last year talking about, and this New Testament church that we now find ourselves discussing, these 3,000 converts, that existed in less time than we have been a church. We started in March of 2020. Our first time meeting together was in June of 2020. So Jesus' entire ministry, actually, if it had started with our church, would be done well over a month ago. And so if you continue to play along this thought experiment, triumphal entry would have occurred August 6th, his betrayal and arrest August 10th, his crucifixion August 11th. So as we're preparing to go back to school, we're launching our false theories and re-engage and all these different types of things that we do as a church. That's about the time that Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection would have occurred for these believers who are in the now experiencing the pouring out of the Holy Spirit. So Resurrection Sunday would have been the 13th. His teaching would have gone from August 14th to the 22nd, roughly. Again, these are just hypotheticals. And Holy Spirit's arrival last week on the 1st. So this New Testament church that we're going to look at today, as we kind of zoom back out. So Luke's been explaining a very specific happening, that moment where the Holy Spirit's been poured out on his people. We're now going to zoom out. We're going to hear about what the church looks like during this period of time. And then throughout the rest of Acts, he's going to do this a couple of times. He'll zoom back in on stories, zoom back out and talk about what's happening for the people. So today we're specifically going to be looking at Acts 2, 42 to 47. So if you've got your Bibles with you, I'd encourage you to pull it out and follow along with me. If you've got your Bible on an app, that's fine. Go ahead and get to that point. I'm going to read it for us, and I'm going to pray, and we'll dive into the text. Acts 2, 42 through 47. They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and signs were being performed through the apostles. Now all the believers were together and held all things in common. They sold their possessions and property and distributed the proceeds to all as any had need. Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the temple and broke bread from house to house. They ate their food with joyful and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. Every day the Lord added to their number those who were being saved. Let me pray for us. Heavenly Father, as we take some time to look at your work in this first century church, how you were moving powerfully and boldly through these people and how they were responding to the reality of being equipped and enabled by the Holy Spirit. Lord, as we look at that, let it not be disconnected from who we are today. We are still your church filled with people equipped and enabled by your spirit. So Lord, let us look at this text and understand what application we can draw from it, how we can apply this to our daily lives, and we can re live in the reality, the same reality they did that they serve a risen Lord or be with us as we, as we go through this, let, let your name be glorified ultimately in all things. We do. Amen. So a text like this, one of the things we have to cover and Chris started this series of acts talking about this a little bit as well, we have to talk about the difference between descriptive texts and prescriptive texts. A text that just describes what's happening versus a text that is actually telling us what we need to do. So in this story, in this section of Scripture, Luke has zoomed back out and is describing what we see in the New Testament church. Now, does that mean that there's nothing prescriptive about this? No, there are things that we can look at that and say, okay, they're responding to the Holy Spirit's work in their life. And this is how they're responding to that work. So how can we apply that to who we are and where we are today? So keep that in mind as we go through these verses. Sometimes there's just descriptions, sometimes there's prescriptions. So the first verse, they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching. So what we have to ask when we look at that, they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, what does that mean? What we see throughout Acts, the apostles are constantly going, constantly meaning daily, going to the temple or wherever Jews gather, and they're proclaiming the resurrection. So much so that it's irritating the religious Jews of the time that this teaching is just constantly being proclaimed. And we see this a couple times in Acts. The first one is Acts 4.2. They were annoyed, they being the religious leaders of the time, the Sadducees, they were annoyed that they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead. So what did the apostles just experience? They had experienced the Messiah who had died and rose again. And they're telling everybody about this. So they've been arrested. They're being told, don't do this. Don't pray. Don't, don't continue to preach. Fast forward one chapter, same thing. They're arrested again. After they brought them in, they had them stand before the Sanhedrin and the high priest asked, didn't we strictly order you not to teach in this name? Look, you filled Jerusalem with your teaching. So this, I get this picture of like the streets are almost littered with pamphlets of like the coming Messiah, the Messiah who's alive, you filled Jerusalem with your teaching and you're determined to make us guilty of this man's blood, which is a really ironic thing coming from the high priest who said, let his guilt be on us. This is the same religious leaders who gladly brought Jesus for crucifixion are now annoyed that people are saying that they're guilty of the blood that they're guilty of. annoyed that people are saying that they're guilty of the blood that they're guilty of. And so the apostles did not learn their lesson. And every day in the temple and in various homes, they continued teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah. And so when we look at this first century church, they're devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching. Well, what does that mean? It means they're having to go with the apostles as they go into these temples and proclaim the reality of Jesus as the Messiah as described in scripture. Well, what's that look like for us today? Does this mean that you need to be coming on a daily basis to the church? We're going to have a sermon each day. You can come sit, listen, and hear the proclamation. Well, no. We have the apostles' teaching. We have it recorded for us, and we're able to read it. We're able to devote ourselves to his teaching daily, to the apostles' teaching daily. This is a thing that we can do. We have it in our phones. We have it online. We have more access to scripture than any person in history. And so, does daily devotion mean coming and hearing a sermon every single day? No, but does it mean getting in the word, allowing the word to be active and alive in you? Well, it does. It does. To the fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer. So here we see, the word fellowship, I think sometimes just gets skipped over, but it's crucial to what's being described here. It's the fellowship of believers. Not just believers living in isolation, but believers living out life together. The breaking of bread is pretty clearly communion. It's something we're going to practice or we're going to partake in here at the end of service. But fellowship, I want to focus on fellowship. Fellowship is something that requires relationship. It requires us to know others and to be known by others. Prayer is a component of this. The breaking others. Prayer is a component of this. The breaking of bread is also a component of this. The reality is we see the, these early believers feeling the conviction of the Holy spirit. How are they acting that out? They're acting it out by living life with one another, which is what we are called to. We are called to love one another and by loving one another, which is what we are called to. We are called to love one another. And by loving one another, that's how people know that Jesus loves us, that we pour that out from the love that we've received from the Father. Fellowship is something that requires connection. So for the New Testament church, the only way they had to do that connection was by meeting physically face-to-face. So again, does that mean that you, if you've gotten into a community group, are expected to daily meet with your community group? I mean, that'd be great. I'm not going to say no, but I don't think that's the obligation here. Again, we live in a time with more access to connection and resources for connection than any time in history. So instead of using our devices to mindlessly scroll, tick tock, if we were using our devices to stay connected to one another, there's, there's an opportunity here for fellowship to look daily, to be daily when you choose to step into fellowship with somebody it can't just be a one-time-a-week thing you're not gonna know the person you're not gonna be able to encourage the person to see them grow to be the the the conviction that they need to experience growth they're not gonna be able to be the conviction that they need to experience growth. They're not going to be able to be the conviction that you need to experience growth. We always talk about, we experience God through God's word, God's people, and God's spirit. God's people is an important component of this. Prayer is another aspect here. Prayer is something that you cannot know how to pray for someone well if you don't know the person well. Prayer is an amazing opportunity for you to connect with somebody on a different level. For you to intercede for them, to bring their needs before the Lord in the same way that they are. It changes your relationship. You can generically pray for individuals, but it's something different when you know their struggles, their desires, their hopes, their dreams, their pains, their frustrations, their sorrows, and you can partner with them in prayer. Praying with them. Great. Praying for them. Great. Both are a component of fellowship. You cannot do these things in isolation. So fellowship is a descriptor of this new Testament church. These, these 3000 believers. Now we're all 3000 gathered in one location. No, from house to house, place to place, they're breaking up into groups. And that's why we encourage you. This meeting here is an amazing thing. It's great to gather with the larger body of believers, to worship together. Worship was amazing this morning. To be able to engage with the word in a corporate manner, that's fantastic. But the daily living out of our spiritual lives with small circles, going from these big lives with small circles, going from, going from these big rows to small circles, that's, that's where you'll, you can start to see real life change both for yourself as well as others around. So that can't be overlooked. Now it moves into, and it says everyone was filled with awe and many wonders and signs were being performed through the apostles. And so again, this is one of those areas where we can't look at this in isolation. We have to look at the narrative of Acts. And right after this, in chapter 3, we see one of these moments where everyone is filled with awe and wonders and signs are occurring. It's actually something that I learned as a kid in a children's song, Acts 3. I'm not gonna sing it, even though that may disappoint you. I'm gonna try not to sing it. I'm gonna say it. So the story is that Peter and John went to pray and they met a lame man along the way who reached out his palms and asked for some alms, an offering. And this is what Peter did say. Silver and gold have I none, but what I do have give I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk. And the man gets up and he goes walking and leaping and praising God, walking and leaping and praising God. Now I learned that as a children's song, and it's great. I love that that section of Scripture is so ingrained here that the reason I said that instead of reading it is because I can't read it. I tend to sing as I start to read it. But for me, because I learned it in this kind of microchasm of a children's song, I disconnected from the rest of the narrative and so what we see here is again with the Apostles daily going and proclaiming the word and that's what's happening in this in this this section of chapter 3 a lame man is encountered by Peter and John as they go to pray, they offer him healing and he's healed. And so now as they're walking to what's called Solomon's colonnade, that's where they were going. They're confronted by people who are curious because Peter and John are now walking with a man leaping. And I imagine this guy probably leaps better than anybody else in Jerusalem at the time. Like this guy is healed, healed his work, his legs work better than everybody's. And this is a person that they recognize and they know this is a person who's not supposed to be leaping. This is a person who sits and asks for offerings. And so they come to Peter and they ask him what's going on here. What is that? What has happened with this man and Peter, like we already learned, who's not afraid to take an opportunity to preach, does so. And so in Acts 3, verse 15, he confronts them. He confronts them with the truth. You killed the source of life whom God raised from the dead. We are witnesses of this. Because again, who's he talking to? He's talking to the Jews that had gathered for these feast days. They'd come to Jerusalem, they had celebrated Jesus coming into Jerusalem, but then immediately after are screaming, crucify him, crucify him. So that's who he's talking to. By faith in his name, his name has made this man strong whom you see and know. So the faith that comes through Jesus has given him this perfect health in front of all of you. What's interesting about this is Peter. Doesn't just leave it at that. He doesn't just say kind of, and I told you so like, Hey, we told you this guy was the Messiah and you crucified him. End of story. He models what he saw from his teacher as his teacher hung on the cross when Jesus hung on the cross there's a moment where we see him as people are sneering and jeering at him as he's dying an unjust death where he cries out to his father and says forgive them they don't know what they're doing. Peter reflects this in his teaching. He says, now brothers and sisters, I know that you acted in ignorance just as your leaders also did. In this way, God fulfilled what he had predicted through all the prophets that his Messiah would suffer. And so he offers them the same thing he had offered that Chris had talked about last week. He says, therefore, repent and turn back so that your sins may be wiped out. See, Peter had learned the reality that we are all guilty in the crucifixion, but that's not the end of the story for us. It's our sins that nailed him there, but as he hung there, he forgave us. He offered us forgiveness. And so Peter's not, he's willing to even go to the active enemies of God. The people who actively called for his crucifixion. He didn't bitterly hold that aside and say, I'm not going to give it to these people, I'm not going to offer forgiveness to these people. Instead, he took that opportunity to boldly proclaim. And so what happens is we see the church to these people, I'm not going to offer forgiveness to these people. Instead, he took that opportunity to boldly proclaim. And so what happens is we see the church continue to grow through this, the apostles teaching the miracles, these signs and wonders, and so this is an impressive thing and it is gathering numbers. People are seeing what's happening and responding to it. Cause you it's, it's hard not to respond when you see something unexplainable lived out in front of you. So let's continue. Now all the believers were together and held all things in common. They sold their possessions and property and distributed the proceeds to all as any had need. It's another one of those fellowship moments all as any had need. So another one of those fellowship moments as any who had need, there is no way for you to meet the needs of others. If you're not aware of the needs of others. Likewise, there's no way for someone to meet your needs if you do not make them aware of your needs. So as we fellowship together, there does seem to be a pretty clear indicator that we need to fellowship together in such a way that we're not hiding the truth of our experience and our existence from one another. We have to be bold to share what our needs are, whether that be prayer or physical need, so that others can bless us. And in the blessing that they give us, they're able to be blessed themselves. Don't withhold that opportunity from each other. Allow each other to know one another. Again, it's hard to do in a room this size with this many people. That's why we want to bring you into smaller circles and make sure that you are getting to know one another. If you're not having those conversations, if you're not having that kind of fellowship, pushing towards that kind of fellowship, you're missing out, you're missing out. Can you get together and share a meal and go home and have a good time? Yes, that's great. I'm all for that. I love meals. But that's not the spiritual blessing that the fellowship of believers gives us. That's an insufficient blessing. Is food great? Yes. But the blessing that comes from being known and knowing others others sharing in their growth, in their struggles, sharing in their sufferings, being there for somebody as they experience loss. That's where true fellowship lies. And that's where true blessing lies. This passage also sometimes gets used as another prescriptive text as though, and I know that as soon as these verses come up, sometimes people worry, oh, he's going to ask us for money. Uh, that's not what I'm going to do. There's not an, there's not an obligation here to give everything you have to the church. I think there is something here to hold everything you have to the church. I think there is something here to hold everything you have loosely. To hold it with an open hand so that as you experienced conviction, as you experienced fellowship, you're ready, willing, and able to meet the needs around you as you become aware of them. I think that's what we see here. And the reason I say it's not an obligation that everybody has to sell all they have and give it to the church is because of a story that shows up immediately after in Acts chapter 4 and the beginning of Acts chapter 5. Now, I want to take a moment to remind us the chapter and verse numbers are not inspired they're helpful the words are inspired but luke was writing a letter he didn't stop every couple sentences and put a number he was just writing a letter it's a narrative that's being written to a friend and so they're incredibly helpful it's helpful to be able to say turn to Acts 4 verse 32 instead of turn to Acts line 2004, which I don't know how you would do. I don't know how you'd do well. And so it is helpful, but it's an addition that came into the scripture about 1500 years after it was written. And so what happens sometimes with those chapter and verse breakdowns is we can disconnect stories that very clearly go together. And so this is one of those situations. And I think the beginning of chapter five likely is familiar to some of you, but you may not have heard it in context with the end of chapter four. Let me read it real quick. So Acts four, verse 32. Now the entire group of those who had believed were of one heart and mind, and no one claimed that any of his possessions was See, again, we're zoomed back out with Luke here. But instead, they held everything in common. He's talking generally. With great power, the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And great grace was on all of them. For there was not a needy person among them because all those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought the proceeds of what was sold and laid them at the apostles' feet. This was then distributed to each person as any had need. So that's the zoomed out story. It's a repetition of what we just read in Acts 2. And then he zooms in. He tells a very specific story. Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus by birth, the one the apostles called barnabas which is translated son of encouragement sold a field he owned brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet that's the entirety of his story his specific instance we're not told if this is his only field if it's one of many fields if it was an inherited field we're just told that he had a field he sells it and he brings the money to the apostles the next chapter then starts but a man named ananias with his wife sapphira sold a piece of property however they kept back part of the proceeds um yeah sorry i'm sorry however he kept back part of the proceeds. Yeah, sorry, I'm sorry. However, he kept back part of the proceeds with his wife's knowledge and brought a portion of it and laid it at the apostle's feet. I'm reminded because of this comparison, this contrast of how Jesus talked about generosity during his teaching ministry. He would say things like, don't let your right hand know what your left hand is doing. He would compare and contrast the giving of a Pharisee. Who's who's making a big show of his, of his offering compared to a widow. Who's giving the last of what she has quietly, secretly in the back. And so what the Pharisees would do is they would, they would, they were great rule followers. They would take the rules as they saw it written in Scripture, and they would make sure that you saw that they were good rule followers. They even wore their righteousness on their bodies. They would dress up in ways that showed off the fact that they were obeying certain laws and certain rules. Now, rules are important. They're given to us for a reason. Generally speaking, the reason the rules are given to us is to show us our guilt. Because what God has been after, what he's always been after, and we see this in David in the Old Testament, in Psalms, after he's committed his sin with Bathsheba, all the way to the New Testament teaching of Jesus is God is after our heart. So it's a heart of generosity, not a show of generosity. So as we're giving, there's this expectation, this obligation that our giving be from the heart and not from this obligation or this show of generosity. And so Ananias wants to be a part of what's happening, seemingly, but his heart's not there. There's still deceit. He wants to be recognized for his generosity, but he doesn't actually want to be generous. And so Peter, in the following verse, in verse three of chapter five, asks Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, to keep back part of the proceeds of the land? Here's where I see that it's not a prescriptive thing. Verse four, wasn't it yours while you possessed it? This was Ananias' property. He wasn't under an obligation to sell this and give this. And after it was sold, wasn't it at your disposal? So even after selling his land, there wasn't an obligation of now turning those monies over. He did so. He entered into this deception willingly and needlessly. Why was it that you planned this thing in your heart? You've not lied to people, Ananias, but to God. And when he heard these words, Ananias dropped dead, and a great fear came on all those who heard. And so this is the reality of the Holy Spirit at work powerfully in this first century church in Jerusalem. We often hear people say, I wish we could see the signs and wonders of the first century church. But they say that when they're talking about miraculous healings. They don't say that when it comes to immediate conviction. I have not heard somebody say, I wish liars dropped dead when they entered into church. I don't wish that I would not have made it through the intro of my message. Well, I didn't lie in my intro, but anyhow, so it's, it's one of those things, the signs and wonders, the awe that fills the people. There's an excitement about this, but there's a component of appropriate fear. They don't enter into this thing lightly. God, as he is moving in this first century church, is looking for commitment. He desires all of the person. This first century church and their commitment to following the way of Christ, that commitment is what took a small movement of 120 Jews, turned into 3,000, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, all throughout Judea to the ends of the earth and eventually to a church in Centerville ohio that happened because of fully committed all-in individuals people who were committed to what god was doing in their life people who were responsive to the conviction they felt and so this this first century, what we're seeing described here are people who are radically following God. Radically following God. And that same spirit who is alive and at work in this first century is the same spirit that is alive and at work inside of us. So the question becomes, what does radically following God look for us today? Is radically following God simply showing up on a Sunday, living my spiritual walk in isolation, going home and doing whatever I want until the following Sunday when I show back up, again, still in isolation? That's not radical pursuit of the one another's that we see practiced over and over and over again throughout the New Testament. So, the last couple verses of this passage kind of summarize for us. It says, every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the temple and they broke bread from house to house and they ate their food. So here's the meals, right? Here's meals. I love this house and they ate their food. So here's the meals, right? There's meals. I love this part. They ate their food with joyful and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And I want you to notice something here. These people lived in such a way that the Jerusalem Jews around them were happy that they were their neighbors. That the Jerusalem Jews around them were happy that they were their neighbors. Their fellowship was so evident and on display, their love, their joy, their desire to be a loving and joy filled people. Led to how the verse ends. Every day, the Lord added to their number, those who are being saved. So what do we see here? What we see here is a people who are so committed to each other, who are so loving of one another, that through their living, through the way that they even just shared meals, praised God, the way that they lived was evangelistic. Just their meeting together was something that God could use to draw others in. Because they loved people in such a way that didn't make sense. This is the type of thing we do have access to today. You can love people in ways that don't make sense. You can love people in ways and offer this reality of what God has done in and through his church. You can offer that in ways that are unexplainable. You can be there for somebody in a time of torment when everybody else would have just said, I'm sorry you're going through that and walked away. There's an opportunity here for the church to evangelize just in the fellowshipping of one another. How great would it be if people were happy that they had Christians living next door? Every day, the Lord added to their number those who were being saved. And again, the preaching was an important component of this. who were being saved. And again, the preaching was an important component of this. But what's focused here at the end is the fellowship. It's the 3,000 unnamed individuals living out their life, committed to what they had heard and what they had been taught. And so one of the things that we see, and we talked about this last week because we got to participate in baptism. That's the ordinance that we have as a church for the new believer. So as people are added, they get baptized, but these people are already baptized individuals. These are people who have been added to the number. And so they participate in the second of the two ordinances of the church. Baptism is a one-time thing for a believer. The ordinance of communion is a reoccurring thing. It's something that we take part in over and over and over again. And so if you are somebody here who is just exploring, you're not sure exactly where you stand with God, you're not sure about this God thing, you're just simply curious and you're checking things out. I would say that communion isn't for you specifically, but it is for you to observe because again, they were living their lives out in such a way that people saw how they fellowshiped. So if you, if you, if you do not have a relationship with God at this moment, I'd encourage you to sit back and just observe this next moment. We're gonna have some music playing and we're gonna enter into a time of communion. And one of the things that is important to remember comes from 1 Corinthians 11, verse 27. I'm gonna read this real quick. So then, whoever eats this bread and drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sin against the body and blood of the Lord. So I want us to take a moment here before we actually open the cup and drink and eat. I want us to take a moment to reflect, to pray, make sure that we approach the Lord's table in a worthy manner. So I'm going to sit here in silence for a little bit. If you want to get the cups, there's cups underneath your chairs, get those ready. And then here in a little bit, I'll kind of lead us through this. Lord, as we approach your table, I pray that you'd search our hearts, point out the areas that we need to confess and be forgiven, because that is something you offer freely to all of us. Lord, thank you for your sacrifice, the reality of your broken body and your spilled blood for us. Lord, bless this little piece of bread and this little bit of juice. Thank you for the reminder that it gives us. Amen. So 1 Corinthians 11 in verse 23. Paul says, For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you. On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread. And when he had given thanks, he broke it and he said, this is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me. Go ahead and peel back the little foil and take the bread. Now the other side of your cup will have the juice. Go ahead and feel free to open that up ahead of time. Paul continues and he says, in the same way, he took the cup after supper and said, this is the new covenant in my blood. Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. Go ahead and drink. He continues, for as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. Let me pray for us, then you can be dismissed. Lord, I thank you. I thank you for the reality that you are a God who is not just high in the heavens and disconnected, but instead sent his son to live and to die, to die a sinner's death that was undeserved and to do so willingly die a sinner's death that was undeserved, and to do so willingly so that we might sit here freely, benefiting from the righteousness that we haven't earned, but has been bestowed upon us by your work. Lord, I pray that as we go, we would be encouraged by what we see in the first century church. These believers who were responding to the conviction of the Holy Spirit poured out in their lives. Lord, let their conviction and their response to it be instructive to us, be encouraging to us. Let it push us towards love and good works. Lord, I thank you for all that you do for us. And I pray that as we go from here, everything we do, everything we say would result in your glory. In your name we pray. Amen."}]}

We are part of God's mighty multiplication movement, planning churches locally and globally. Why? Because there's still so many people and unreached people groups who have yet to hear the good news of Jesus. Every year my family has prayed and given to the Be More offering because we know that there are billions of people across the globe who have never experienced God's goodness or even heard of the name of Jesus. Right now our lives are crazy busy with kids and work schedules but this is one way for us to be a part of something so much bigger than us, a way to share his name and love across the world. In 2022, Fearless Church planted for David. Because of your generosity, we've been able to focus all of our efforts on building a movement of missionaries who love their neighbors and make disciples with no financial uncertainties. We believe the seeds we've sown are going to change people's lives and bring those who are far from God near to Him. And it's all because of you. We can't thank you enough. Hey, Feelers Church, you are making a difference through your partnership with India Gospel League. You are making it possible for a church to be planted in every village of India through the Adopt-a-Region project. Over the next five years, you're going to make it possible to plant 360 churches in unreached villages. Thank you for what you're doing. So what can you do? I'd encourage you to pray and ask God what he would have you to do. If you're led to give financially you can go to BeFearless.org and click on give. Last year over $60,000 was raised and every dollar went to multiplying movements. God might even lead you to be part of a future church plant going out from fearless either way i'm excited to see what god is going to do let's be more together well good morning and welcome to fearless church if're watching online, we're glad that you're joining us today. I want to kick off responding to that video real quick and remind you, if you're part of the Fearless family, what our vision is. And if you're not, that's okay. This is helpful information as well. Our vision is basically our answer to the question, what is it that we believe God is calling us to do as a church? So when you think about us as a whole, think about what we're gonna do next year and the years to come, what is the vision, what is the direction we believe God is taking us? We like to say it this way, that our vision is to initiate a mighty multiplication movement of God. Now what in the world would that look like? That would look like us actually becoming disciples who make disciples. A disciple is simply a learner or a student, a dedicated follower, a disciple specifically of Jesus Christ, that we would know him, love him, obey him, and that we would be disciples that would help other people become disciples, followers of Jesus that help others follow Jesus. And that makes us all nervous, myself included, because I don't know everything there is to know about Jesus. In fact, there's some days I'm really good at following him and some days not good at all. And we all feel that way. And I would say it like this. Our job is not to fill their cup, but simply empty our cup. We can share what we know, not everything there is to know about Jesus or how to perfectly follow him, but we can share what we know. So that's our calling, to share with as many people as we can, being disciples who make disciples, emptying our cup, sharing what we know. But also going beyond that, that we would work together to actually become a church who starts churches. Now, some of you may have heard this if you've been in the church world before, this term megachurch. And the idea would be to get as many people in one location as possible. There's some amazing mega churches in our community and around the world, and that's awesome. That's not what we believe God's called us to do. What we believe God has called us to do is become a multiplying church. Our goal, our prayer, our efforts, our strategy is to get more people outside these walls, more people in more places to be a multiplying church across the street. And that just means here locally, like the church you saw Pastor Chris Volz mentioned for Dayton, that's a local church, but also around the world. Now, when we think about partnering with people that are part of this mission, we would say it this way. We partner with individuals, churches, and organizations with a similar vision, that is to make disciples and start churches among unreached people groups. Now, what in the world does that mean? That's a missiological term. So there are people that dedicate their lives to figure out how do I statistically look and consider sociological trends and all these things to get the good news of the gospel to as many people as possible. Well, these groups of people have identified something called unreached people groups, which just means it's a group of people where there really is not a large enough community of people. It's usually less than 2% in a culture, okay? So if there's 100,000, right, there's less than 2% are followers of Jesus, which means that it is difficult for those that are followers of Jesus in that and among that people group to be able to make disciples without some kind of outside support. support again we love to partner with individuals organizations other churches one of the organizations i want to highlight is one you saw in the video the india gospel league back in 2020 india gospel league developed and basically began pursuing a vision called achieve 2040. the vision is this a life-giving and multiplying church established in every single village in ind India by the year 2040. At that time, there were over 350,000 rural villages. So the vision again is to start over 350,000 churches among the unreached people groups of India by the year 2040. And that's crazy. Now I would tell you, as we think about unreached people groups think about how we define churches oftentimes we picture a building we may picture a crowd of hundreds of people igl would define a church as this at least 20 adults in that church that are followers of jesus that have been baptized who are committed together regularly just like we are for prayer for worship bible study to observe ordinances ordinances like the Lord's Supper or baptism. And when they have a group like that, that church, that's considered a church. Now, here's the way IGL works. They have challenged us to say, okay, because you believe in strength in numbers, there's power when you work with other people, other individuals, other churches, other organizations. So IGL has created what they call a consortium. The consortium, again, is a group of people and churches that collaborate together to adopt a region. And I wanted to share with you, back in June, we adopted this region called Cathal. Cathal is about the size of Connecticut. It's found in the state of Haryana, which is located at this portion, the north part, north, maybe west part of India. Because Allah has millions of people that have never heard the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We began working with them in June. Since June, I want to celebrate and share with you, we've had over 120 people that have made a commitment to follow Jesus and be baptized. And not only that, hang on just a second, and already 16 different churches have been started among that people group. So that's something we could celebrate together. Praise God for that. And our goal, our goal, and you heard it on the video, is to work with this people group, not only this people group, but this is one of our target groups for the next five years. And so of course, this time of year, we do it always throughout the month of November, we collect something called our Be More offering. And anybody can participate in this. And I just want you to know, if you give towards this offering, you can find it out online or whatever, every dollar goes towards starting churches and engaging unreached people groups. Starting churches and engaging unreached people groups. Starting churches both across the street, here locally and globally like India. Now, the India Gospel League shared with us something that's interesting as we've begun this endeavor. They said, did you realize in order to start a church, a multiplying church in India, it costs $1,600. Now, you may read that. And for some of us, we're like, man, that's a lot of money. For most of us, we look at that and say, I wonder how much it costs to start a church in America. So to start a church in America. So to start a church in America, it's a lot more than that. That's all I'll tell you, right? But $1,600 provides all the training and resources a local church pastor would need to start a church, especially their first year as a church. And every church that started in India has the goal before the first time they meet together to say, you know what? We are training our leaders to start a second church, be a multiplying church by the end of the first year. And so practically speaking, you spend $1,600, you start one multiplying church, and you can imagine they begin to multiply year after year. And if we're doing this thing for the next five years, that means a fearless church gives $1,600 towards starting one multiplying church that easily, even if we have more of a realistic number, we might say over a dozen multiplying churches could be started in India in a matter of five years. That's an amazing reality. Now, as I begin to pray through and dream through and think about that and think about how many people watch online and how many attend, I started to think, what if, what if each of us contribute just a little? And what if instead of one church, we were able to fully fund 10 churches in 2024? And I just want to show you, if that was something that we did, those churches would multiply, be part of a mighty multiplication movement of God, such that there could be well over a hundred churches in India so that people could hear the good news of Jesus Christ. I share that with you because if you're a part of Fearless Church, as you're thinking and praying, I want you to think about this reality and how you may be part of that whether it's a portion that all that what about your family what about your community group your regen group your re-engage group what if all of you work together and somebody gave 50 somebody gave 100 and together what if all of us together gave enough and i realized that'd be like sixteen thousand dollars but we could start ten multiplying churches. Why would we do that? Not just because we think it's a good idea. We get that idea from one of the New Testament authors. His name is the Apostle Paul. You've probably heard that name before. Listen to what he said. He said, my ambition has always been to preach the good news, that's the story of Jesus, wherever the name of Jesus has never been heard, rather than where a church has already been started by someone else. Now, why was this his goal? Well, this was part of a strategy for him. He said, I've been following the plan or the strategy spoken of in the Holy Scriptures where it says, and then he quotes from the prophet Isaiah, Isaiah 52. He says this, those who have never been told about him will see, and those who have never heard of him will understand. This day, today, over three billion people are alive that are among unreached people groups. In other words, less than 2% of their community, their country, whatever group they are part of are followers of Jesus. For many of them, it's 0%. In other words, they could wake up and spend all day long looking and saying, I think there's some kind of God. I can look in the sky and see all these things in nature. There's some kind of controlling power, higher power. What is it? Who is it? And no one among their people group would be able to tell them. And among that 3 billion people, over 1 billion live in India. This is the strategic location we believe to go and share the good news of the gospel. So here's what I want do. I wanna, before we dive into the message, I wanna pray for the people of Cathal and I also wanna pray for us. Pray for us as we faithfully commit to start churches and engage unreached people groups. So let me pray out loud. If you'll follow along with me and just pray quietly, let's pray together that God would continue to redeem and rescue the people of Cathal and continue to put a burden and a conviction and a passion in our hearts to start churches and engage unreached peoples. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you, God, so much for this vision that you gave the Apostle Paul to go and share the good news to people in places that have never seen and never heard. And Lord, that's a plan that's been laid out in scripture for years, and you have called us to do the same and so lord we want to pray right now for this special group of people in catholic millions of people today that have never heard about jesus that in the next year and years we would see not just 120 but thousands if not millions come to know you as our lord and savior god do everything in your power through your people to rescue them from hell. Lord, to bring them the good news of the gospel salvation. Use us, Lord, use our resources, use our energy that we may not just go, that we may pray and give as well. And Lord, I pray for us as a church in these early years as a church that it would be adopted into our DNA, that we would be a church that says, it's not about us, it's about reaching people beyond us, that we'd be a church that faithfully start churches and engage unreached people groups, whether it's the person across the street or across the world, that we would be faithful to be your witnesses. God, we love you and we ask that you speak to us now as we open up your word and challenge us, challenge us for this week to be all who you've called us to be and to do all that you've called us to do. We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, today I'm excited because we are wrapping up a rather long message series entitled The Movement. And so we started this semester, as we entered into September, we said, okay, if God's called us to initiate a mighty multiplication movement, if God's called us to be disciples who make disciples, to be a church that starts with churches, we need to go back to our roots and look at and say, okay, where did this movement, this Jesus movement begin? And so we decided to study the mighty multiplication movement of God according to the book of Acts. And this movement actually began with a promise from Jesus Christ. Jesus died on the cross, three days later, rose from the grave. And then he spent 40 days, 40 days in his resurrected state before he ascended to heaven. And the day that he ascended to heaven, he told his most committed followers of Jesus. He said this. He says, you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. You can read all about that in the book of Acts, Acts chapter 2. And this Holy Spirit's going to empower and enable people to do what? To be his witnesses. Jesus, what does that mean? It just means you're going to tell people about me everywhere. And then Jesus started to describe, this movement is going to begin in Jerusalem, but it's not going to stay there. It's not going to be contained to this one city, this one location. It's going to spread out to Judea, Samaria, and ultimately to the ends of the earth. And throughout the month of November, what we have looked at is Acts chapter 13 all the way through Acts chapter 28, this ends of the earth. We've watched this man by the name of the apostle Paul and him and his buddies, they were going everywhere, telling everybody they could about Jesus Christ. And one day they find themselves in the city of Ephesus and Luke tells us that paul he feels compelled or prompted by the spirit to ultimately go back to jerusalem where it all started and then he says after that i feel like god is telling me to go to rome to tell them about jesus in rome and so the leaders in ephesus are like man that's dangerous like if you go to jerusalem there's some great persecution going on right now among the people who are followers of Jesus. Paul, this is not a safe thing, but he tells them, he says, look, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, I feel like it's burning within me to go to Jerusalem and I don't know what awaits me except that spirit as I pray about this thing, God tells me that jail and suffering is what I have to look forward to. Well tells me that jail and suffering is what I have to look forward to. Well, Luke records for us, as they arrived to Jerusalem, very quickly, this came true. When they first arrived, everybody welcomed them warmly. They're followers of Jesus. Paul comes in as a follower of Jesus, but that warm welcome didn't last very long. In fact, the next day, Paul went with us, and that's Luke talking about himself as well, meet with James, a key critical leader in the church in Jerusalem, and all the other elders, they were present, and he starts sharing with them the things that God had accomplished among the Gentiles. So he shares with them some of the things that we've learned throughout this month. You're welcome to go back and look at the messages, but some of the cities and people and places, he's like, man, we would go there, and among the Gentiles, that's anybody who's not a jew gentiles were considered unclean they were considered disregarded by god now these gentiles when they hear about jesus they actually believe and many of them commit their life to follow jesus and they receive the holy spirit and paul's telling them all about how god's done these amazing miraculous things and they're excited and they celebrate and they say well paul we want to share with you what God's been doing in Jerusalem. Literally thousands of people in Jerusalem have decided that Jesus is the Messiah. They've committed their lives to him. They've been baptized, but we have a problem. What's the problem? And they said, these Jewish believers here in Jerusalem, they've been told that you're going around teaching Jews who live among Gentiles to actually turn their back on the laws of Moses. to actually turn their back on the laws of Moses. He says, they've heard that you teach their children not to be circumcised or circumcised, excuse me, their children or to follow other Jewish customs. And this was simply not true. Paul wasn't telling people and teaching people to abandon Jewish law and customs. Rather, he was encouraging them to understand what is the meaning behind the laws and the customs. As we study the law of God, so the first five books of your Bible, it's called the Torah or the law. So Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. This law was precious to the people of Israel. And this law paved the way and it revealed to the people of Israel many things prophetically pointing towards Jesus Christ. And he says, look, Jesus, he's the fulfillment of the law. And then for the Gentiles, they weren't asked to follow the laws. They didn't need to. They were experiencing the freedom that we find in Christ when we follow him in salvation. But the Jews there that day were telling Paul, look, they think you're preaching against, you're disrespecting, disregarding all of our customs. So they said, what do we do? What do we do? Because they're going to hear you're here and things are going to go south really, really quickly. Now, what's interesting, again, Paul's heart was not to abandon the law, but he decided, and this is very important, it's a good example for you and I as followers of Jesus. He said, I'm not going to use my freedom to prevent someone coming to Christ. In fact, he would later describe how he adapted to his audience, to the people that he was serving among. In fact, in the church in Corinth, he wrote this. He said, even though I'm a free man, in other words, my relationship with God is based on God's grace, not my good works. So that means I'm a free man. I can eat what I want to, go where I want to, all that kind of stuff. It's not sin, but I don't have to follow all these laws and customs that often are just a bunch of rules that prevent me from walking out in freedom. He says, but I've decided I've become a slave to all people. I changed my approach. Why? To bring many to Christ. And then he gives this example. He says, look, when I'm with the Jews, I live like a Jew. Why? To bring the Jews to Christ. When I'm with those who follow Jewish law, I too live underneath that law. Even though I'm not subject to the law, I did this. Why? So I could bring to Christ those who are under the law. So Paul says, you know what? There's no big deal. What I'll do is I'll just go with these guys over here who are going to the temple tomorrow for a purification ritual, and I'll fund it. I'll pay for the sacrifice. I'll pay for what needs to happen. And he does that. He shows up because he's got no problem with following the Jewish laws and customs. And there he is in the temple with these guys observing purification, rites and rituals. And all of a sudden these people see him and they start shouting out, men of Israel, help us. That's the guy. Look, there he is right over there. over there he preaches against our people everywhere and tells everyone to disobey jewish laws he even he even makes the temple unclean and disregards it by bringing in gentiles the day before they had seen paul walking around with a buddy of his from ephesus who was a gentile and they just assumed he brought that guy to the temple and he didn't do that but they assumed that and so you can imagine that all the crowds hearing this and saying that's the the guy that's speaking against us. And so a huge riot takes place. And they ultimately grab Paul, drag him out of the temple, immediately close the gates to protect the temple, to protect the holy place, so he couldn't go back in. And so as they do that, people are yelling and screaming. Now at the time, Jerusalem was occupied by Rome, controlled by Rome. So there's Roman soldiers there watching this. And they're like, dude, this guy's about to be killed in the streets. So like any good law enforcement, they step in and they say, hey, wait a second, wait a second. What's going on? And they grab Paul and they ultimately arrest him to protect him. They arrest him to protect him. And Luke even tells us they had to put him on their shoulders because people were just clawing at him and everything. And so as they're taking him into the prison paul says stop stop stop i won't address the people and they're like all right so he stands in front of the group of people and he says wait everybody you know i'm i'm born a jew i was trained to be a pharisee i know the law i know the costumes remember don't you know my story like i used to be against those who follow jesus i would go and persecute him. In fact, one time I went to the high priest here in Jerusalem, and I got orders to go to Damascus and arrest followers of Jesus. And he said, and I'm on my way there minding my own business. All of a sudden, there's this huge light in a voice. And back in that day, when you saw a huge light in a voice, you listened. I would recommend you do that as well. well both services nobody wrote that down that is good advice like if you're on the way home today and you know you need to stop and listen so he listens and the voice says saw saw that was his hebrew name why are you persecuting me and paul of course responds back so who who are you who is this and he says i'm jesus of nazareth so he's telling these guys i met jesus on the road to damascus he told me to go to Damascus, and I couldn't even see. The light blinded me, so my companions led me there. This guy named Ananias shows up. Ananias prays for me. I was able to see, and Ananias describes to me, God's got a purpose for your life, to go tell the good news about Jesus to the world. Quit persecuting the church and start propelling the church. This was my mission. And then he describes to me, he says, now a few weeks after that, I'm in Jerusalem, in the temple, praying to God. And God gives me a vision. And God tells me, the people of Jerusalem, the Jews living in Jerusalem, they're not gonna accept this message. And he goes on, he says, but the Lord said to me, go for I'll send you far away to the Gentiles, to the unclean Gentiles, no way. The crowd listened to him until he said that. They said, man, you're done. Away with you. You're not fit to live. And again, this Roman guard's like, what is happening? Everybody's going crazy. He pulls him back in and he says, you know what? I gotta find out what this dude did. And he said, we're gonna beat a confession out of him. So they tie Paul down. They get the whips out. They're ready to just beat it out of him. He says, hey, you're going to torture a Roman citizen? And of course, wait a second, Roman citizen. Yeah, I deserve a trial before being tortured. So they start to inquire and say, wait a second, you're a Roman citizen. Would you buy your citizenship? He says, no, no, no. I was born in Tarshish. Like I am a Roman citizen by birth. And so that commander's like, I'm not gonna get myself in trouble. And so the next day he gets Paul before the Jewish high council. And he's gonna say, now we're gonna find out. They're gonna rule what you did wrong. And so as Paul stands before the Jewish council, he notices the council is divided in two major sections. You have the Pharisees and you have the Sadducees. The Pharisees and Sadducees were both religious teachers and rulers and leaders, but they disagreed. The Sadducees, they didn't believe in spiritual realities. They didn't believe in angels. They didn't believe in spirits. They didn't believe in the resurrection. So taking advantage of their division, Paul actually says, you know, today I think I'm divided because I believe in the resurrection of the dead. Right? And all of a sudden, everybody's like, the Pharisees who believe in the resurrection of the dead, who Paul came from in his education, they're all like, you know what? This guy ain't bad. Like, I like him. And the Sadducees are like, no, the resurrection's a lie. And they start fighting again and arguing. And this Roman guard's watching all this. They grab Paul. They're about to tear him apart. He runs in and he says, we got to stop this. He grabs Paul again, takes him back to jail to protect him. And then that night, the Lord appeared to Paul and said, be encouraged. Just as you have been a witness, you've done your job here in Jerusalem. Now it's time to move on. You must preach the good news in Rome as well. Well, that night there were about 40 different Jews that said, you know what? There's only one way to resolve this. We got to kill him. And so they came up with a plan and they made a vow to God and to one another. They said, we're not going to eat. We're not going to drink until we kill and assassinate this guy named Paul. And so one of Paul's nephews, his brother's sister, or his sister's son, excuse me, heard this was gonna happen, and he went to Paul while he was in prison. He said, look, they've got this plan. They're gonna ask you to come back to the high council tomorrow, and when you come back, they're gonna kill you on your way there. So of course, Paul says, you gotta go tell the commander. He tells the commander. The commander's like, all right, we got to get him out of here. We got to protect him. Let's send him to Caesarea. Let's send him to the governor of Felix. And so they write a letter to Felix and they say, I don't know what this dude's done, but it's causing all kinds of issues in Jerusalem. They're trying to imprison him, ultimately put him on a death sentence and kill this guy. Like, I don't know what's going on. And so they send him with over 400 troops to go protect him in the middle of the night, get him over to Governor Felix. He says, all right, I'll put him in my jail cell for now until we can have the trial. Five days later, five days later, some of the high priests show up and the council, and they start to present their case. And they said, this guy's causing problems all over the place. He's a part of this cult, this cult of Jesus followers. Like there's this rabbi from Nazareth and he's part of that. And finally they kind of say, we gotta do something, we gotta imprison him, we gotta kill him, whatever. And Governor Felix says, okay, now let me hear your case, Paul. And he says, look, I'm not gonna deny. I'm not gonna deny that I'm a follower of this Nazarene. It's not a cult. I believe he's the Messiah. And he begins to talk about Jesus. Well, Felix was familiar with that. So he kind of halts it. He says, wait a second, wait a second. I'm not gonna make a ruling and a decision today because of his political position. He said, I'm gonna wait and get some advice from a different commander that will be in at a later time. And so he takes Paul, he puts him in he wants but he kind of has to stay around there underneath guard and while he's there felix took advantage with his wife who was jewish and he would send for paul and they listened to him they wanted to know more about this faith in christ jesus and paul would reason with them about a righteous life how to be righteous before god not just live righteous but be righteous and he says and about self-control and the coming day of judgment, well, as you can imagine, just like me and you, when they hear about the judgment of God, Felix becomes frightened. He says, go away for an hour, he replied. When it's more convenient, I'll call for you again. So as I'm praying and reading this story this week, this really stood out to me because this sounds a lot like me. So many times when it comes to following jesus or obeying jesus it's not convenient is it when it's more convenient like dude i am all in and i'm part of this mighty movement of god after the holidays after i graduate i mean i got a lot going on after i get my career started after we get married after we kids, after the kids start school, after the kids move out, after the kids move out again, like after retirement, like we always have, like honestly, you don't have to say it, but I'll say it for us. A lot of times the things Jesus calls us to do, the things he calls us to be, it's not at a convenient time. And if we're not careful like Felix, we'll say, man, when it's like, when it's more convenient and here's the problem, the mighty movement of God will not be convenient. So we, as a church, we can hear this kind of language and we can talk about it. Oh, initiate a mighty movement of God. We got to realize there's not going to be a time when we have enough in an account. We've trained enough people, whatever it might be. I'm not saying we don't be faithful to plan and prepare as best we can, but it's not going to be convenient because Jesus calls us to follow him on his terms, not on ours. So this goes on kind of cycling and Felix and his wife have these conversations like this and they hear more about Jesus and go away, wait till it's more convenient. For a couple of years, finally, Felix's, his term is done as governor and the new governor comes in named Festus. Well, three days after Festus shows up, he actually goes to Jerusalem and he says, what's going on with this guy named Paul? And they all say, hey, bring him back to Jerusalem because they had in their minds, hey, on his way back here, we're just going to kill him. Assassination will be perfect. Get this thing done, right? And he says, no, no, no, no, no. I'm responsible. We'll try him in Caesarea. We'll try him in a Roman court. And so he do. A few days later, he has Paul standing before. The same thing plays out, right? All the religious leaders are like, he's causing riots. He's not observing that. And then he's like, I don't know. This just sounds like some piddly religious regulations, it doesn't sound like something that a man should be in prison or even killed for. He says, Paul, are you willing to stand before the high council in Jerusalem? And Paul says, no, I ain't doing it. I'm a Roman citizen. I deserve a Roman trial. I appeal to Caesar, which means I'm going to the Supreme Court. Like I'm going to, I know my rights. I'm going to protect myself in this equation. Now, remember, Paul knew the Holy Spirit had told him what? You're gonna go to Jerusalem and Rome. So the Holy Spirit's nudging him to be bold and brave in the front of people, in the front of persecution. And so they end that council that day. A few days later, there's this guy named Agrippa. King Agrippa and his sister Bernice, they show up to just pay honor to the new governor of Caesarea, Felix, or Festus, excuse me. And so they're sitting around talking one night after dinner, and he says, hey, you know, I got this problem. Felix didn't take care of this dude named Paul. Now I got this problem that they want to execute this guy. I don't think he's done anything wrong. He's telling the whole story. And Agrippa says, man, I'd like to hear this guy. Fine. Tomorrow we'll go meet with him. So they go and they actually have a huge kind of gathering just like this. I mean, thousands of people gathered in a huge Colosseum and they're going to have this kind of mock trial that they're going to play out in front of King Agrippa and his sister Bernice. And so they tell, they say, okay, Agrippa, maybe you can help us write a letter to caesar because the problem is we don't know why we're even sending him to rome and so they start talking to paul and paul says hey look i've done nothing wrong i obeyed all the jewish customs and laws and i was ultimately arrested and all this kind of stuff there like i'll admit i'll admit i did say before them hey i do believe in the resurrection because i do i believe the hope of israel the messiah arrived, and I believe that he rose from the grave. And he's describing all this, and he says, on my road to Damascus, I had this encounter, just like we talked about, this amazing story. And he says, as I've realized this, I've preached this message in Damascus and Jerusalem throughout all Judea and to all the Gentiles. What's the message he keeps preaching? He says, all people, doesn't matter if Jew or Gentile, must repent or turn from their sins and turn towards God. Well, how do we even know if people do that? And he says, it'll be proven, it'll show by the good works they do. In other words, our obedience is the fruit of our salvation. We know whether we've really turned to God based on how our lives are being transformed. Not that we're perfect, but are we making progress in our faith, in our obedience? Paul continues on, he says, some of the Jews arrested me in the temple for preaching this message of repentance. They tried to kill me, but God protected me right up to this present time so I can testify to everyone. Not just you, King Agrippa, but everybody in the auditorium that day. From the least to the greatest i teach nothing but what the prophets and what moses had said would happen and what was that that the messiah would suffer it was ultimately part of god's plan that jesus would die on the cross not stay dead because it was ultimately part of the plan that he would rise from the dead and that this way would announce god's life light not only to the jews but to the gentiles as well well festus is like dude you're crazy you're crazy you studied too much and then he defends himself he said wait a second king grippa he he's familiar with this he's familiar with the story of jesus you can claim this you can back this up right and a grip is like dude you think i'm becoming a christian today no chance and so agrippa grabs his sister and festus and they go back in the back room they discuss and, man, there's really nothing this guy's done wrong. We could release him had he not appealed to Caesar. So Luke tells us in the final chapter of Acts, or one of the final chapters, when the time came, they set sail for Italy. Paul and several of the prisoners were placed in the custody of a Roman officer named Julius. And so they begin to make their way to Rome. And at some point they're going to port or end up in a place where they could stay the winter three or four months because during the winter is too dangerous to travel by sea was they're going port to port the weather's getting worse week by week and so paul finally says to him look we gotta stay here if we keep going we're gonna lose cargo we're gonna lose lives this is not gonna be good and of course julius is like you're not the. You don't know anything about sailing. I'm trusting the captain and the owner of the ship. So they continue on. Well, sure enough, the next day, a wind gust blows them away from the shoreline. They end out in this huge storm and Paul does what I would do. Told you so, right? And they're about to die at sea. And Paul says, don't worry, don't worry. Cause last Don't worry, don't worry, because last night, there stood before me an angel of God to whom I belong, whom I worship, and here's what he said. Don't be afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar. You're gonna make it to Rome. And behold, God has granted safety to everyone sailing with you. And he says, look, I have faith in God. God says it, I believe it. That's the good news, he said, but the bad news is we will be shipwrecked. And sure enough, sure enough, on the 14th night of that huge storm, they let down. They want to find out how deep they are. They're 120 feet. A few hours later, they let down. They're 90 feet. And they realize, hey, the wind's blowing us towards shore. We set anchor. Paul talks to them all that night. He says, you guys haven't even eaten for two weeks. Like you guys have got to eat something and then we'll unload whatever cargo we have. And when daylight comes, we'll make our way there. Well, daylight came, they look and they see a shoreline in the distance and they're like, so let's go for it. So they pull anchor, they start heading there and the wind blows them against some rocks. They run short, the ship starts breaking apart. One of the officers, Roman officers, the man, we gotta kill all the prisoners. They're gonna escape. They're gonna escape they're gonna swim to the island and they're gonna escape it's gonna be horrible and julius speaks up he says no no no no no no no because he knew he didn't want paul to die he had a relationship with he trusted paul paul trusted him so we're not gonna kill the prisoners instead here's what he said he said if you know how to swim swim if you don't grab a piece of wood and so they did in fact luke tells them every one of them made it to the island he says it this way once we were safe on shore we realized the island was that of malta and so while we're there they were kind to us and they start building a fire well paul joins in to help build the fire and while they're building the fire a snake actually fills the heat and comes out of the fire and bites paul on the hand paul holds it up and it's just dangling a poisonous snake and all the people on the island are like, oh man, God got him. You know, he may have escaped God's justice from the sea, but now, now God's got him. And of course, Paul, like Indiana Jones, he pulls the thing out and he's like, no, he didn't bite his head, but that would have been cool. He throws him into the fire, snake dies, right? And they're like, all right. And in about 15 minutes, he'll be dead. He doesn't die still alive hours later. The leader of the island says, hey, I need to talk to you. There's something crazy about you or God. What's going on? He says, no, I serve God. He said, you need to meet my dad. He's dying. Paul prays for his dad. His dad is miraculously healed and others are as well. The people of Malta celebrate. They stay in Malta about three months. Finally, they get on a ship once winter's done. They finally get their port and go up after a few weeks and finally end up in Rome. And Luke tells us when we arrived in Rome, Paul was permitted to have his own private lodging, though he was guarded by a soldier. So think of it like house arrest. And when he's first there, he gathers all the Jewish leaders and he tells them all the things that I just told you. He tells them all, this is what all has happened. And I've been arrested and charged and i have not broken any jewish law or custom i'm just telling you the hope of israel the messiah he has arrived he's here and so they respond and say we want to hear more about this we want to hear what you believe for the only thing we know about this movement this jesus movement is everywhere it goes it seems to be denounced or prevented or it seems to come with persecution so they arrange a time and date and they get a large number of people together and then paul explains and testifies about the kingdom of god and he tries to persuade them about jesus from the scripture not just from his personal experience jesus did the same thing after the resurrection jesus would go to scripture because god's word points to god's son. And so the scriptures he uses the same Jesus did, the law of Moses and the prophets. And he spoke to them. He said, this is the Messiah. I'm telling you, he has come, he has died, he has risen from the grave. Well, that day, some of them were persuaded. They said, man, we believe. I think Jesus is the Messiah. And that's great. Others were not persuaded. Paul wasn't surprised by that. In fact, he said, man, the prophet Isaiah said, some of you are gonna see and not believe, you're gonna hear and you're not going to understand. That's going to happen to some of you. And he goes on and he says, look, I just want you guys to know that this salvation from God has been offered to the Gentiles as well. It's not limited to just one group of people. It's not limited to. In fact, he was announcing a new part of salvation history where Gentiles would be more receptive to the good news of the gospel than even the Jews. And Luke closes the book of Acts with these phrases. For the next two years, Paul lived in Rome, again, under house arrest at his own expense. He welcomed all who visited him and boldly proclaimed the kingdom of God and teaching the Lord Jesus Christ and no one tried to stop him. So Paul has this limitation of having to stay in Rome until he can stand before Caesar, which was clearly in church history teaches this as well, at least two years later before he could stand trial before Caesar. But he didn't see that containing the messenger meant that it would contain the message. He believed with all his heart that the movement of God could not be contained, and that is the reality. It's not contained. You may stop the messenger or the individual, but you cannot contain the movement of God. You cannot contain the message. In fact, the Apostle Paul would say, in Rome, in prison, is where God inspired me to write four, four different documents that we recognize today as Holy Scripture. Three letters to churches, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians, and one letter to a personal friend known as Philemon. To this day, to this day, many of you, myself included, believe those are Holy Scripture. They help us understand who God is and how to follow him through his son, Jesus Christ, and how to live this thing out. Inspired by the Holy Spirit, written by Paul, while he was captive in prison. In fact, he said to the church in Philippi, he said, look, I want you to know, dear brothers and sisters, that everything that's happened to me has actually helped, helped to spread the gospel. Everyone here, including the palace guard, the guys watching me day by day they know i'm in chains because of jesus and because of my imprisonments most of the believers here have gained confidence and they boldly speak god's message without fear you cannot contain the mighty movement of god so if this is true that the mighty movement of god is not going to be convenient and it's not gonna be contained, we have to ask ourselves two questions. The first question is a question of convenience. If not now, when? And I really wanna know, in your mind, when is it more convenient to become a follower of Jesus? Like what are you thinking in your mind? Maybe I'll wait till the end of my life. Maybe I'll bank on God's mercy and like in my final breath, that's when I'll commit. What about for a lot of us? You've already committed to follow Jesus. So my question is, when is it more convenient to obey Jesus? Is there something he's telling you to do and you find yourself coming up with good reason? I mean, everybody's sitting around you would agree with you, man, I've got to get through this thing first or that thing. I would just warn you that convenience is often the enemy of obedience. Convenience is easy. It's simple. Obedience is hard. It's challenging. It's complicated. It requires faith. And so many times when I look at my life and I look at the disobedience in my life, it's because when God was telling me to do something required faith it wasn't convenient jesus invites you to follow him today based on his terms not yours we don't just ask a question of convenience but we got to ask a question if it can't be contained we have to say then what what's honestly stopping me what's preventing me from following jesus what's preventing me from obeying jesus what's preventing me from following Jesus? What's preventing me from obeying Jesus? What's preventing me from being part of the mighty movement of God? Going to people and places no one else wants to go. And I found for me, it's usually in one of three categories. Sometimes it's all about me. Some of you have this, like there's a past failure, something you did and you know it's sin, you know it's wrong, you don't want to share it, and you think, man, I can't do that, or it's some kind of insecurity, or some kind of present struggle. I'm struggling with this, and because I don't have all this together, I can't be part of the mighty movement of God. I can't be part of his mission. Or maybe it's them. There's somebody in your mind, my parents, my boss, my spouse, my kids, my employee, whatever it is, or maybe it's it. It's some kind of life stage or situation. Maybe it's financial, maybe it's physical, maybe it's academic, maybe it's professional, whatever it is, and you're saying, if I didn't have this, dude, like I understand you're getting all excited up there and like, I, dude, I wanna follow Jesus. I wanna be used by God to do things that really matter for all of eternity, but I've got this thing here that's stopping me. We have to remember the mighty movement of God. It's not gonna be convenient and it's not gonna be contained. So what if we developed a now and nothing mentality? This is how Paul thought. He thought to himself, now is the right time. Today is the day of salvation, not tomorrow. We don't wait till it's convenient. We go all in and say, you know what? Jesus, I'm ready to follow you now. What if for some of you, that's the reason God has you here today. You've been battling this thing. You got some kind of plan in the new year or after this or that or whatever it is. And Jesus is saying, no, not now. And Paul thought not only now is the time to join the mighty movement of God, but he says, nothing can stop it. I mean, he said, sure, sure. When I preach this good news, I suffer. I'll acknowledge the reality. They've contained or chained the messenger, but they can't change the message because the word of God cannot be chained. No one and nothing can stop the mighty movement of God because the mighty movement of God cannot be contained. We can't stop it, but yet we're invited to join it. But we have to be open. We have to be honest that if we join it, we have to remember that it's not going to be convenient. It's not going to be easy. Yet Jesus invites us to a faith-filled, fearless adventure where he would say to you and me, come on, come on, come on, come on. Go, go, be my witnesses to the ends of the earth. To that lady at work, to that guy at the lunch table, to the neighbor across the street, to the person in India, whatever it may be. Like go, go, go, you can do it. What, like honestly, you ever think about this? What if we did ever become a church that had a now and nothing mentality? That we felt like it was our generation, it was our time, we don't want to miss it. Now is the time to be part of the mighty movement of God and nothing can stop it. Like where would we go? What would we do? Who would we become? I don't have to wonder. We've spent the last three months looking at what happens when a normal everyday group of people surrender to the holy spirit to transform them and to use them to transform others lives if we decided to surrender and say now now is the time and nothing will stop us i know what we'd become we'd become fearless followers of jesus who changed the world us, I know what we'd become. We'd become fearless followers of Jesus who changed the world. And this is what the movement's about. God created you, not just so you could survive. And let's be honest, some of us, that's right where we're at. We're just surviving. You're just, you're just glad you didn't kill nobody over Thanksgiving, right? You're like, all right. And you're just hopeful tomorrow you'll be able to pass that test. You won't be laid off. Hey, you're made for more than that. You're made for an extraordinary eternal impact. There is no one like you. There will never be anyone like you. When God sees you, he sees a guy like the Apostle Paul. A mighty, mighty warrior for Jesus Christ. At Fearless Church, we are not okay with status quo. At Fearless Church, we wanna see and experience the infinitely more that God can do through each and every one of us. He invites you to join the movement and become a fearless follower of Jesus who changes the world. Let's pray. God, I thank you for this story. It's crazy when I think about the apostle Paul and all that he went through and his willingness to be bold and brave, even to be limited, man, to be in prison for two years. None of us want that. But yet he saw you can't contain the word of God. So in his mind, he was like, yeah, you can stop the messenger, but you can't stop the message. And so, Lord, I pray we would be bold, even though it's not convenient, it's not easy, Lord, that we would join this mission because there's nothing greater. Paul, you said to live is Christ, to die is gain. You knew, hey, I know, I know my life is more when I follow Jesus. And I pray that that would be what we would do, God, that you would help us become fearless followers of Jesus who change the world. We love you. Pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen."}]}

We wanna be like a river sending people out where people come in, they stay for a few months, maybe a few years, possibly a few decades, but eventually are sent out from here to help make disciples and start churches. But if we're going to be part of this movement, we have to at some point ask the question, how? How are we going to do this? So what we did is we began a study of the movement. The movement began with a person. His name was Jesus Christ. So at the very beginning of this year, we started looking at the life of the ministry, of the teaching, ultimately the death and even the resurrection of Jesus Christ, according to the gospel of Luke. You've probably heard before, there's four gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, four different perspectives, four different stories that tell us about Jesus. And so we focused on Luke, and today we're going to look at Luke's sequel. Luke actually wrote not only the Gospel of Luke, but he also wrote Acts. And so we're going to, if you brought your Bible, you can start turning there, Acts chapter 1. We're just going to look at a phrase or a couple of sentences that Luke thought was so important to record from Jesus Christ. A phrase or a couple of sentences that were so important to the movement that God wanted to do. So again, if you have your Bibles, let's look at this moment, this conversation Jesus had with his apostles only three, maybe four weeks after the resurrection. Check it out in verse four. Once when Jesus was eating with his apostles, he commanded them, don't leave Jerusalem. Stay here until the father sends you the gift he promised, like I told you before. Now, what gift had the father promised his people? Well, these men were Jewish followers of Jesus. And so they were familiar with the Jewish scriptures. And they were familiar with what prophets had said long ago. In fact, there was a prophet by the name of Ezekiel. In fact, you can see some of his prophecies in the Old Testament book of Ezekiel. And Ezekiel shares this prophecy. And he is speaking on behalf of God. Listen to what he says in chapter 36. He says this, if I can get there. It froze again. This is two weeks in a row. How exciting. Okay, there it is right there. See if you can stay there for just a minute. Let me see if I can go forward and then back. There we go. All right, so he's going to give you a new heart. So anytime you read that phrase, a new heart, what that's talking about, not a literal, you probably already know this, right? Not a literal heart transplant, but a changing of your will, of your desire. In fact, if you think of the heart like the mission control of who you and I are, how we make decisions, everything that's the core of who we are. He says, I'm going to give you a new heart. And remember, this is Ezekiel speaking on behalf of God. This is what the sovereign Lord says. I'm going to give you a new heart. How? I'm going to give you a new spirit. That's how I'm going to make this heart transplant. That's how I'm going to transform you. He says, I'm going to take away your old stony, I'm gonna put my spirit, the spirit of God inside of you. Once that spirit's inside of you, it changes everything. You'll be able to follow all my decrees and you'll be able to obey all my regulations. It will transform your life completely. Now, this prophecy that God spoke through his prophet, Ezekiel, was about 600 years, a little over 600 years before Jesus says this statement. The Father is about to do that. He's about to send you the gift that he promised long ago. This anticipation of one day God would not just be out there or even in this case with Jesus right here, but God would be in us. And then Jesus continues. He says, look, John baptized you with water, but in just a few days, everything's going to change. In just a few days, you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit. I want you to notice he starts with John. John is another prophet of God, a more recent prophet of God. Now, Luke knew this was very, very important. He was going to read words both from Acts and Luke that he recorded because he wanted us to understand who John the baptizer was. In fact, John the Baptist was a prophet of God that was predicted about 500 plus years before by the prophet Isaiah. John mentions, or excuse me, Luke mentions that in his gospel. Listen to what he says. He said, Isaiah spoke of John when he said, and this is from Isaiah chapter 40, he said, he is a voice shouting in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord's coming, clear the road for him. So somewhere around the year AD 25, John the baptizer shows up. Again, for about 400 years, the nation Israel had not heard from God. He seemed silent to them. No prophets, nobody saying, thus says the Lord. Listen, this is what God wants you to understand. So he had been seemingly silent. And now there's this prophet by the name of John. John was baptizing people and people were like, okay, well, this must be the Messiah. In fact, Luke records these words. He says, everyone was expecting the Messiah and they started to wonder, man, is this him? Like, is John the Messiah? Well, John, listen, he refutes them and he rebukes them and he answers their question whether he's the Messiah. Listen to what he says. He answers by saying, look, I baptize with water, but prepare yourselves, get ready, because someone is coming soon who is greater than I. I can't even, I'm not even worthy to untie his sandals. He, he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. So John says these words. As Jesus is coming on the scene, the next three and a half years, Jesus teaches like no one else had taught before, with great authority. He did miraculous things. He loved people in a way nobody else loved. He eventually went to the cross and died. And then the craziest thing happened, and most of you have heard this before. He rose from the grave. And now, a couple of weeks later, after raising from the grave, about three and a half years after John says this, Jesus says, hey, you're about to be baptized with the Holy Spirit there was a baptism of water now there's gonna be a baptism the Holy Spirit again what is this baptism what was John's baptism we've got to go back Luke records these words John says John's baptism excuse me Luke writes this John's baptism was to show people what to show people and so they could recognize and repent of their sin and be forgiven by God. So in other words, when John was dunking people underneath the water, these people were lining up from all different regions, and they were saying, I recognize I'm broken. I recognize I have sinned against a holy God. I recognize I need God's forgiveness. And John is continually baptizing them, symbolically, ceremonially washing them, preparing them for the Messiah that would come. And this is John's baptism, but Jesus's is very different. Jesus's baptism is one of the Holy Spirit. And this, this, my friends, is the story of Acts. The story of Acts is watching as God pours out his spirit on his people. The story of the baptism of the Holy Spirit of God's people. Why? Because God's movement starts with God's spirit. If we ever hope to be a church that actually initiates a mighty multiplication movement of God, where we become disciples who make disciples, where we work together to be a church that starts churches. We have got to be a church that's filled with the Spirit of God, because God's movement always starts with God's Spirit. So over the next couple of weeks, we're going to watch this movement. We're going to watch the movement of the Spirit of God. But before we do, before we dive in, what I want to do for a few moments is I want to pause us and talk about this question. What is baptism of the Holy Spirit? Now, depending on your church background, some of you read that question and you're like, finally, we're going gonna be a real church, right? Others of you read that and say, finally, we're gonna be a weird church, right? And then others of you that aren't familiar with that at all, you're like, I'm neutral. I don't know what in the world, baptism of the Holy Spirit. That just sounds weird to me. Let me share with you. Baptism of the Holy Spirit is this experience we have with the Holy Spirit that transforms us, that empowers us, and unites us as a church on mission for God. It transforms us. It empowers us, and it unites us. One of our roles as a church is to reflect the image of God to the world. In fact, if you go all the way back to Genesis, Genesis will tell you that God made man, humanity, in his own image. Male and female, he made them. All of us reflect his image. And one of the ways we reflect his image is in our diversity. It is a good thing that we come from different backgrounds. It is a good thing that we are different ages, different stages, different colors. It is a beautiful, wonderful thing that we are both diverse and unified. How does that reflect the image of God? Because there is one God who exists in three persons. He is both diverse and unified. All three are the same, and they're equal in their characteristics and their attributes, but they're also three different. There's a diversity and a unity about God that he wants to reflect in us and through us as we are both diverse and unified. So what unifies us? What unifies us is not that we always have the same preferences or the same desires or that we agree on everything. What unifies us, watch what Paul says. He says, some of us were Jews, some of us are Gentiles. And that's important because, again, first century Jews thought, no, no, we're the people of God. And God's about to do some stuff that includes others, non-Jews, Gentiles into the people of God. And he says, look, some of us are Jews, some of us are Gentiles, some slaves, some free. We all have these different backgrounds, but all have been baptized into one body. Okay, so we've all been dunked underneath the water. Is that what you mean, Paul? He says, no, we've been baptized into one body by one spirit. And baptized into one body by one spirit. And this is really, really important because it means we share the same spirit. Regardless of your background, we share the same spirit. And this is really, really important. He told the church in Ephesus, he said, you have got to make every effort to make sure you stay united. Because again, we reflect the image of god how by our diversity and by our unity in fact one of the things that hurts the church in our culture is how divided we are we divide over a bunch of silly things and that shouldn't be the case we are to be one as the father and son are one there's to be this beautiful unity among our diversity and he says fight for that be unified in the spirit and he says this for that be unified in the spirit and he says this is how you build yourselves together with peace so how do we do this Paul like how do we stay unified remember remember the unity of one so he continues on he says for there is one body in other words just one church I know we gather in different locations but ultimately we are one group of body of believers many Many parts, one body. There's one spirit, the Holy Spirit, just as you've been called to one glorious hope, the kingdom of heaven. He continues on. He says there's one Lord, talking about Jesus, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father who is over all and in all and living through all. One baptism. So you gotta ask yourself this question. What is the baptism that unites us? What is the baptism that transforms us? What is the baptism that empowers us? Because remember, Jesus says, oh, there's two baptisms. There's one with water and there's one with the Holy Spirit. Which is the one that unites us? Which is the one that empowers us? Which is the one that unites us which is the one that empowers us which is the one that transforms us this is important now 30 years later one of his closest disciples the apostle peter you recognize that name peter what he denied christ ultimately jesus forgave him and and it was a beautiful pitch peter is a key leader in the church listen what peter says if there's not enough confusion on which baptism is important p Peter says this, now baptism now saves you. Now, wait a second. I don't know your church background, but if you've been a part of Fearless, you know what we say all the time. A person is saved. A person is made right with God by faith alone in Christ alone. And wait a second. Now we have Peter telling us baptism is the thing that saves you. What do you mean, Peter? And he says, no, no, this is not the removal of dirt from your body. It's not the ceremonial cleansing act of dunking somebody underneath the water. If it was, we would have a different mission. We would get the strongest guys in the church and we'd say, come on up here. We're going to get really, really fast. We're going to, but not effective, right? Because he says, that's not the baptism that saves you. It is a response to God from a clear conscious. It is a heart decision that change you. Now, wait a second. If John's ceremonial baptism doesn't save you, how does a response to God save you? And again, Peter writes, he says, it's effective because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is a response to God in regards to the work of God. See, John's baptism was a prophetic placeholder. It kept the place. It kept the place where people were saying, I recognize someone's coming after John. I need something from God. I need a forgiveness. I need atonement. I need something. And then Jesus shows up on the scene, and he is that someone. He is that Messiah that walked in sinless. And when he went to the cross, he died on the cross, not for his sin, but for your sin and my sin. And when he took on that sin, he died. Our sin was punished through Jesus Christ, but then he rose from the grave. And when he rose from the grave. And when he rose from the grave, it changed everything. Because of the resurrection, people are able to respond to God through Jesus Christ and experience a baptism that now saves them. What is that baptism? That baptism is baptism of the Holy Spirit of God. And this is what Paul says to Titus. He says, this is the process of how that works. So the baptism that saves you is the baptism of the Holy Spirit. This is how it works. He says, when God our Savior revealed his kindness and love, he saved us. Once you notice who saves us, it's God. Now listen to this carefully. Our God is a just God. He is a righteous God. He is a holy God. He is a righteous God. He is a holy God. And because our God is just and righteous and holy, our God punishes any and all sin. And that's news that we don't always like to hear. But because you're made in the image of God, I want you to know that's in you as well. Because think about it. When you see injustice in this world, something stirs inside of you, and what do you tend to say? I want justice. The reason you say that is because you're made in the image of God and our God is a just God. So just know a just God punishes all sin. And here's the strange part. The same God who punishes our sin is the same God who saves us from our sin. So how does he do this? It's not. It's not based on our conduct. It's not based on the righteous things we do. And this is really important because I think a lot of people say, I wanna be made right with God. And the only way I can do that is if I'm good enough. You might believe that. You might be watching online and you're just hoping, man, I hope I do enough good stuff. If something horrible happens this week in my life and I stand before God, I hope the scales weigh out that I've done more good stuff than bad stuff. And right here, Paul's saying, that's not how you're saved. No, instead, you're saved because of his mercy. We're not saved by our conduct, but rather by his character. You are saved, I am saved because of who he is, not what we do. See, the character of God both punishes sin and saves us from our sin. Justice and mercy. Mercy is withholding a righteous judgment. So God withholds that judgment, but at the same time through Jesus punishes our sin. So he is making a way to both be just and mercy. You are saved not because of your good character, but because of God's good character. So how does he do that? He washes away our sin. Okay, so how does he wash away our sin? Check this out. He washes away our sins by giving us a new birth, a new life through what? The Holy Spirit. Your washing of regeneration, your new birth, a new life through what? The Holy Spirit. Your washing of regeneration, your new life, your new birth comes from baptism of the Holy Spirit. When does this happen? He says, he, speaking of God the Father, generously poured out his spirit upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior. Watch what happens. Mercy from the Father, sacrifice from the Son, cleansing from the Spirit. This last summer we did a series over the Holy Trinity. And the Holy Trinity is so important because all three parts of the Trinity are essential to your salvation, are essential to my salvation. A just God punishes sin. Why or how? Through his Son, Jesus Christ. And when someone commits their life to Jesus Christ, they're forever connected to the Father. They are cleansed by the Holy Spirit of God. So when someone commits their life to Jesus Christ, they're forever connected to the Father. They are cleansed by the Holy Spirit of God. So when did this happen? When was the Spirit poured out on us? And that's the story of Acts. That's what Jesus is saying. In that moment, historically, if you want to know when the Spirit of God was poured out on the people of God, it happened in Acts. In Acts chapter 2, as we're gonna see in a couple of weeks, this is when God pours out his spirit. And this is so important because as we study the mighty multiplication movement of God time and time again, we're gonna discover God's movement, it starts with God's spirit. We need God's spirit. This is why Jesus said, don't leave, don't leave, because until you receive the Holy Spirit of God, you do not have the power of God to accomplish the mission of God, because God's movement always, always requires and starts with God's Spirit. So we need the baptism of the Holy Spirit. We need the Holy Spirit in our life. Now, the baptism of the Holy Spirit does what? It transforms us. Not only does it transform us, it empowers us, and it unifies us. empowers us, and it unifies us. Now, the hard part is, sometimes what happens is the enemy gets in between us and we start to have division, not unity. And division in regards to the baptism of the Holy Spirit starts with this question right here. Well, when? When does baptism of the Holy Spirit occur? There are some people that would say, man, baptism of the Holy Spirit occurs the moment, the moment you commit your life to Jesus Christ, you are baptized in the Holy Spirit occur. There are some people that would say, man, baptism of the Holy Spirit occurs the moment, the moment you commit your life to Jesus Christ, you are baptized in the Holy Spirit. There's other people that say and have experienced, no, no, no, no. Yeah, I may have received the baptism, I may have received the Spirit there, but something happened a few days, a few decades later. And some of you have this story. There was some kind of experience in my life, and I was baptized by the Holy Spirit at a later point. And people that have experienced that second one, they will refer to the book of Acts. And in the book of Acts, we see some of this happening. And Acts chapter 19 is a great example. Apollos and Paul are partners in ministry. Well, Apollos stays up in Corinth. And Paul, he begins to travel down through the interior regions until he reached Ephesus on the coast, where what did he find? He found several people who were believers. Now watch this conversation. He says to them, have you received the Holy Spirit when you believed? So you believed. When you believed, did you receive the Holy Spirit? And they say no, no, we hadn't even heard there is a Holy Spirit. Then he asked them this question, well then, whose baptism, what baptism did you experience? And they say, and it might not surprise you, the baptism of John. That's who everybody was receiving, baptism of John. And then he goes back to what we've already talked about. And he said, well, John's baptism, that was for repentance of sin. That was to help you recognize your need for a savior. He says, but John himself, he pointed people towards Jesus to believe in the one that would come later, meaning Jesus. So they hear this message and they're just sitting there and they say, all right, man, we believe that. And so that day they were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Hooray. Awesome. Cheering. Great. Wonderful. And then weird stuff starts to happen. Check this out. Then Paul laid his hands on them and the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke in tongues and prophesied. Now follow this. They believed, then they were baptized as believers in the water, and then later received the Holy Spirit. And not only that, not only that, but when the Holy Spirit came upon them, they began to speak in languages they didn't already know. They began to prophesy and say truths about God that they didn't already know. They begin to prophesy and say truths about God that they didn't already know. They begin to say things that just were not of themselves. And throughout the book of Acts, we see times when the Holy Spirit comes on people that it results in these miraculous signs. In two weeks, we're gonna read these words. Everyone present was filled with the Spirit, and guess what they began to do? They began to speak in tongues as the Holy Spirit gave them ability. In Acts chapter 10, you see that Jewish believers, they were amazed. Man, the Holy Spirit of God has been poured out on the Gentiles. How did they know? Because you guessed it, they started speaking in tongues, languages they didn't already know. So what has happened is people have experienced, and they say, you know what, I've experienced this moment where I can't explain it, but I begin to experience something with the Holy Spirit separate from the moment of my salvation. And so they will ask you, or maybe you have asked people this question, have you ever received baptism of the Holy Spirit? Have you ever received baptism of the holy spirit have you ever received baptism of holy spirit again it's this idea that there's this second experience after salvation that we can experience with the holy spirit that enables us and empowers us in a unique way now oftentimes i think the better way to ask this question that people, when they ask you or you ask others, and you may say this is a weird way to ask it, but I think what people are saying is this. Have you ever experienced a physical manifestation of the Holy Spirit? Now, when I'm talking about physical manifestations, it's some kind of experience that you've had with God. Maybe it was in a worship moment. Maybe you were in a small group. Maybe you were alone by yourself, but in a worship moment maybe you were in a small group maybe you were in a alone by yourself but some kind of physical manifestation such as speaking in a language that you didn't know like tongues or or another one they got slain in the spirit so you're like i don't know what happened but i just kind of passed out fall out as another one uh holy laughter i just started laughing uncontrollably something that people will describe and they will say, I had this experience. It didn't seem controlled. I was uncontrolled. It was unexpected. And God just began to do something through me. And it was really, really weird. And they will tell you, I think in that moment, the physical manifestation that I was experiencing was baptism of the Holy Spirit. And maybe you've been taught that. Maybe you've had that kind of experience and you're saying, yeah, that's right. Like, I committed my life to Jesus Christ. Weeks later, months later, years later, I was baptized in the Holy Spirit. Now, here's the problem. Here's the problem. Remember, what does baptism in the Holy Spirit do? It transforms us, it empowers us, and it unites us, and here's what happens. If we're not sure if we're not sure that this is the way it is to be then what happens is people that have had that kind of experience they come and share with great joy i've had this experience it's awesome but what about those that don't have that experience followers of jesus like many of you that have been highly committed to christ man you've been following him some of you for years or decades and you're like man i never had, I've never spoken in tongues, I've never felt a physical presence, I never, none of that has ever happened. What's wrong with me? And what happens is, inadvertently, inadvertently, we create a two-class system. Those who are followers of Jesus who have been baptized by the Spirit, and those who are followers of Jesus who have not been baptized by the Holy Spirit. So, what's right? What we've gotta decide is what gets the first and final word. And God has provided us not just the book of Acts, he's provided us 66 books of the Bible. So what we have to do, we have to do, and then Paul talks about this, he says, we have to do our best to present ourselves to God as one approved, a worker who needs not be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth. In other words, we've got to correctly interpret the Bible and correctly apply the Bible. And one of the interpretation tools that we have to make sure to hold tightly to is we've got to use God's word to interpret our experience, not our experience to interpret God's word. We've got to make sure what has the first and final authority? What does God's word say that helps me understand? Because many of you have had an amazing experience. There's been things that are uncontrolled, supernatural. You felt the presence of God and the person next to you, guess what? They love Jesus just as much and they haven't had that experience. And if we're not careful, we can cause division, not unity. And what is baptism of the Holy Spirit supposed to do? Unify us. One spirit, we share the same spirit. So with that being said, how do we rightly handle the word of truth? How do we in a holy way stand before God as workmen of proof? I'm going to give you a key to interpretation. It's context, context, context. Easy to remember. The three most important things of real estate is what? Location, location, location. So always think context, context, context. When I'm reading something, I'm gonna look at the context of the book. So in this case, Acts. I'm gonna look at the Testament. In this case, the New Testament. the 27 historical documents. So it's part of a packaged deal. The New Testament came after Jesus Christ, right? His birth, his life, his death, everything after Jesus, right? That's what the New Testament is. And the Bible, the 66 books of the Bible that we believe are inspired by God to communicate to you and I. So when we look at a book context, we're asking three basic questions. What is the historical context? So what's happening in the history of the world? When this is right, who's the author? Who's the audience? Like what's happening geographically? What do I need to know in the historical context? And we know the part of text we're reading right now, Jesus has just risen from the grave a couple of weeks ago. And he's telling them the father's about to send the gift he promised. John baptized with water. In just a few days, you're gonna be baptized with the Holy Spirit. Grammatical. The Bible is written in three languages, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. All three of those languages, we would put the word biblical in front of them because all three of them are dead in one sense. So there's a modern Greek, there's a modern Aramaic, a modern Hebrew, but those are not the same languages. There's similarities as biblical. So you can actually look and study. There's software out there that you, some of it's free, you can buy. You can actually go to seminary. You can get your doctorate degree if you want to in biblical Hebrew, but what you're doing is you're trying to say, what is the original text? What did it really say? And finally, the literary genre. So think about it. In the Bible, we have things like poetry, right? We have parables. We have hyperbole. We have apocalyptic literature. We have narrative. We have teaching literature, all kind of stuff. So we're asking this question. Well, then what's the literary genre of the book of Acts? That's the right question to ask. Well, it is a historical narrative. What that means for us is whenever we're reading a historical narrative, we're asking this question. Is this telling us what did happen, or is this telling us what should happen? Is this descriptive or prescriptive? And we do this with other parts of the Bible. Like, in fact, if today, for some reason, you had the resources to be able to go over to Israel and go to the edge of the Red Sea, what you're probably not going to find is someone standing there with a staff, holding it up, waiting for the Red Sea to part. But many people, myself included, believe that the Red Sea did part. That is what happened, and there's things to learn from that but it's not what should happen today. And so as we go through, and you may say, well wait a second, if we're going through Acts, are all we gonna learn is what did happen? Isn't there some examples? Of course there's some examples of course there's some examples some things that should happen today so how do we know which things should happen again how do we rightly handle the word of truth context context right we look at the next context the context of the new testament so what we're looking for is we say okay this looks like something that happened so it appears that the holy spirit of god came came after the point of conversion. So what we need to do is find some of the teaching literature. Do you know over 20 of the historical documents that make up the New Testament are in this genre? They are teaching. It is people like Paul, 13 letters to individuals and churches, teaching them how to follow God, teaching them how to interact with the Holy Spirit. You've got Peter, you've got James, you've got Hebrews, you've got various books that are under the teaching literature. So then the question becomes what? Okay, well, what does the teaching literature of the New Testament say about baptism of the Holy Spirit? And here's the interesting part. Not one time in any of the teaching literature or even in the book of Acts are we told to be baptized by the Holy Spirit. We're not even told to seek baptism in the Holy Spirit. Instead, as we study the teaching literature of the New Testament, we're told to be filled with the Spirit and not to quench the Holy Spirit. So how do I quench the Holy Spirit? Because this is something I'm pretty good at, I can tell you I do that. You know how you quench the Spirit? Continue disobedience to God. You wanna stifle, you wanna strangle the spirit of God out of your life, just continue with a sin that's secret usually, you don't tell anybody, and it's just a sin that keeps being repeated in your life. Let that sin fester because you can't be filled with the spirit and filled with sin at the same time. You'll quench the Holy Spirit. You wanna be filled with the spirit, it's very similar. Continued, persistent pursuit of obedience to God's word. The more obedient you are, the more the spirit of God fills you. Now, here's what happens. Some people have had an experience where they've had a moment where they felt filled with the spirit of God. And they would tell you, that experience had a physical manifestation of the spirit. One of my friends says, man, I was just stuck to the ground. I can't explain it. She was in a large worship service. She just got stuck to the ground. She said, I felt such peace, such comfort, but it was so real. And I got up and I know it was the Spirit of God because it transformed my love for Jesus was greater, my love for His Word, obedience, all this kind of stuff. I felt moments where I felt like there was a hand on my back. Some of you, some of you, you've had a physical manifestation of the Spirit. But here's what I would tell you. Here's what I would tell you. I would tell you that that is typically the exception, not the rule. In fact, the Apostle Paul would say, don't quench that, like don't quench it, but test it. Make sure it's from God, not from yourself or some kind of emotional response or some kind of manipulation of some kind of moment in a worship service or whatever. Make of manipulation of some kind of moment in a worship service or whatever make sure you test it well how do i test it how do i test it how do i hold on to what is good how do i abstain from what how do i make sure it's from the spirit of god one of the ways you'll know if it's from the spirit of god is every time you see someone filled with the spirit in the new testament it became a blessing to those around them even in the book of acts acts chapter 2 were filled with the Spirit, they start speaking in languages they didn't already know. Well guess what? There were a bunch of people there who spoke languages they didn't know. And all of a sudden, in one moment, God reflected and showed his desire for all nations to come to know him by allowing all nations in that moment to hear the good news of the gospel in their own language. Again, it was a blessing to others. Throughout the book of Acts, you'll see these Jews were like, man, they're Gentiles. Gentiles are bad. Gentiles are unclean. Gentiles are dirty. And God's like, no, no, no, they're becoming part of us. They're going to be the people of God. These Gentiles commit their life to Jesus. And they're like, all right, yeah, but they're just kind of second- the gospel. Anytime you see someone, in fact, the Apostle Paul would say, look, look, you may or may not have some kind of physical manifestation, some kind of physical experience. But if you want to know if you've been filled with the Spirit, the Spirit of God is going to produce in you love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Gonna produce in you fruit and evidence that becomes a blessing to those around you. Being filled with the Spirit isn't just simply an experience that you may or may not have some kind of physical manifestation. It is the character of Christ formed in and through us in a powerful, powerful way. So let's get practical. When does baptism of the Holy Spirit occur for us? You're probably like, Jesus said wait there, so it's pretty important. We can't do the mission of God apart from the Spirit of God. Again, where should we go? The New Testament teaching literature. And when we look at the teaching literature of Paul, he explains it very clearly. He says, when you heard the word of truth, what's the word of truth. What's the word of truth? The gospel of your salvation. What's the gospel? The gospel is that there is a just God who punishes any and all sin, including yours and mine. And that God punishes sin by death and eternity separated from him in hell. But God also is a merciful God who is loving. So he has provided a substitute to take on your death and my death. That substitute, you guessed it, is Jesus Christ. When your death and my death. That substitute, you guessed it, is Jesus Christ. When Jesus Christ came, he was sinless. He didn't die for his sin. He died for my sin, for your sin. He was eternal. That meant his sacrifice was once for all, pay the penalty of all people. And anybody, anybody, Paul says, who believes in Jesus, something radical happens in their life. Let me take you back to the words of Peter. Remember, Peter said baptism now saves you. Not just a ceremonial dunking act, but a response to God. Here's the reality. Not all people who hear the word of truth, not all people who hear the gospel respond to God, but notice he says a response to God results in a baptism that saves you. Let me show you this. What's the response to God that results in salvation? It's trusting God to save you, not because of what you've done, but because you believed in Jesus. Anyone who responds to God and believes in Jesus receives baptism of the Holy Spirit. This is why Paul said, you're sealed, you're baptized, you're indwelt with the promised Holy Spirit. And this is so important because this spirit is the guarantee of our inheritance. It's God's seal on you. You are a kingdom kid entitled to all the freedoms and the rights of the kingdom of God. You are sealed with the promised Holy Spirit. And this is so important to Paul because he says, look, if you don't have the Spirit, you don't belong to Jesus. So when are we baptized by the Holy Spirit? We're baptized by the Holy Spirit. Remember what Paul said, you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and you believed in jesus and when you believed you received the promised holy spirit and in that moment we have to make a decision as followers of jesus am i going to quench the spirit or am i going to be filled with the spirit so when are we filled with the spirit because apparently we have the ability to quench or stifle out the spirit of god in our lives or be filled with the spirit so how i I'm at, let's go again. New Testament teaching literature says what? Paul says, you were made alive by the Spirit. In other words, you were baptized by the Holy Spirit. You were indwelt by the Holy Spirit. You were received the Holy Spirit, whatever word you were to say, but let us, what? Follow the Spirit's leading. Let us be filled with the Spirit where? In all the easy parts of your life. If your translation says that, you need to get rid of it. It's in every part. Finances, marriage, parenting, sex, all those parts you really want God to have control of, right? He says, I want to be in charge of every part. So how do I make sure I'm following the Spirit's leadership? It's not as weird or strange as you think. You obey God's word. Because as you and I obey God's word, we are filled with the Spirit. As we're filled with the Spirit, we will obey God's word. This is the promise the Father made to us. The promise we heard through the prophet Ezekiel. When you receive my spirit, it's gonna result in following and obeying me. You may or may not have a physical experience a physical manifestation but if it's truly if it's truly being filled with the spirit you will have spiritual transformation you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation you believed and you received and then as i make a commitment say i'm going to not quench the spirit but be filled with spirit by obeying the word of god all of a sudden something begins to happen god begins to transform my life all of a sudden the people around me they may not see a physical manifestation but what they see is the character christ they see love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness self-control compassion mercy they see all these wonderful attributes of christ this is how we change the world becoming a church that is filled with the Spirit of God. This is why Jesus said, don't leave. Don't attempt to do this mission apart from the Holy Spirit of God, because God's movement starts with God's Spirit. Let me let you know, the change and the transformation God wants to do in your life, the sin He wants to rescue you from that's defeating and destroying parts of your life, it starts with His Spirit. What God wants to rescue you from that's defeating and destroying parts of your life? It starts with his spirit. What God wants to do through you, the miraculous, amazing things, starts with his spirit. Do we want to be a spirit-filled church? The answer is yes, yes, and yes. But we're not going to be simply satisfied with a few small, simple, physical manifestations of the Spirit. We want to be a church that seeks out the eternal spiritual transformation of our lives by the Spirit of God. Our determination is to be a church that initiates a mighty multiplication movement of God, and it will not happen apart from the Spirit of God. What would it look like? What would it look like for us to be a church that's daily led by the Spirit and directed by the Word, a church that strives to be filled with the Spirit of God, to be transformed, empowered, and united by the Holy Spirit of God? That, my friends, is the type of movement that God wants us to be a part of. God's movement, God's movement starts with God's Spirit. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, I pray you help us experience what it is to live a spirit-filled life. Lord, we wanna be transformed by your spirit. We wanna be renewed by your spirit. We wanna be united by your spirit. We wanna be empowered by your spirit. God, let us become that type of church that is led by the spirit and directed by the word. A church that becomes part of this movement that you started so many years ago this movement that we're part of today that we get continue on in our generation lord lord do a movement among us and god use your spirit to start that movement it's in jesus name we pray amen, Amen."}]}

Write a sermon that encourages the congregation to recognize and embrace the power of the Holy Spirit in their lives, and to actively participate in God's movement by sharing their faith with others.\n\nSermon:\n\nHave you ever experienced the power of God working through you? Those moments when the right words come to you unexpectedly, or when you make decisions that seem almost out of body? This is the power of God at work in our lives. But what does it look like for the power of God to be working in you and through you? How do we access this power?\n\nLast week, we began a new message series called \"The Movement,\" where we are studying the mighty multiplication movement of God according to the book of Acts. The goal of this series is to understand how the Holy Spirit empowers us to be part of this movement.\n\nIn Acts, we see the beginning days of the early church, when the Holy Spirit comes upon the 120 followers of Jesus, and they go from a small group to thousands in a matter of days. This was a miraculous movement, and it's still happening today. In fact, there are over 2.5 billion people alive today who follow Jesus, making up over 30% of the world's population. We are part of a mighty movement, and God invites us to join Him in it.\n\nBut how do we access this power? The answer is simple: through the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is what empowers us to be part of this movement. It starts with His Spirit working in us, drawing us towards pursuing Christ, and then through us, as we share our faith with others.\n\nJesus told His early followers not to leave or start pursuing the movement apart from the gift of the Holy Spirit. He said that in just a few days, they would receive the Holy Spirit, and when they did, it would change everything. The mighty movement of God is impossible apart from the Spirit of God. But it's not just the Spirit of God that we need. We, as believers, have a role to play in this movement.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is all you have you ever experienced the power of God working through you I mean have you ever had one of those moments where you're in a conversation and all of a sudden the right words just come to you and before you know it you're saying stuff and it's almost borderline like out-of-body experience because you're saying things that you couldn't imagine, or maybe you're making decisions or doing things that you're like, man, I don't know how I decided to do that. I don't know. The power of God was working through me. Or are you in the category who said, yeah, but I, I mean, I guess that's possible, but I don't think it's possible for me. I mean, the power of God working through people, that's something for other people. I mean, what would it even look like in your life? Honestly, what would it look like for the power of God to be working in you and through you? I mean, how do you even access that kind of power? If we have access to God's power, how do we access it? Last week, we kicked off a new message series entitled the movement and the the goal of this series is to study the mighty multiplication movement of God according to the book of Acts and again if you go back to the book of Acts you're going to find the beginning days and stages of the early church in fact I would encourage you to log on next week or or be back here next week because we're gonna talk about these 120 followers of Jesus that it all kind of began the moment the Holy Spirit comes upon them. And they go from 120 in a matter of no time to thousands. And they move from Jerusalem and it begins to spread out. And that was a bunch of amazing, miraculous things that happened in the first century church. But honestly, it's kind of crazy when you think about it. Throughout all the history of the world, the last 2000 years, here we are in the 21st century, hundreds of people in this room. I don't know, dozens of people online. I'm not sure that make up some 2.5 billion people alive today that follow Jesus. Over 30% of our world's population. We are part of a mighty movement, and God invites us to join this movement with Him. We talked about this last week. We said this movement starts with God's Spirit. It's true individually, and it's true for us together. So in other words, what God wants to do in your life, it starts with His Spirit. Those are some of those thoughts or feelings or circumstances that happen in your life it starts with his spirit those are some of those thoughts or feelings or or circumstances that happen in your life and you feel like man something's going on something's drawing me something's pulling me towards pursuing christ knowing christ following christ it starts with his spirit working in you but then through you the power of god and apart from his spirit there is no movement in fact, Jesus wanted his early followers, his kind of band of brothers, those 12 disciples known as the apostles, right? They were selected and he said, this movement is gonna start with you guys. And he told them, he said, don't leave. Just don't leave. Don't start pursuing the movement, the mission of God, apart from the gift that the father's promised that he's gonna give you. What's that gift? It's the gift of the Holy Spirit. He said, in just a few days, in just a few days, you're gonna receive the Holy Spirit. And when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, that's gonna change everything. The mighty movement of God is impossible apart from the Spirit of God. But it's not just the Spirit of God that we need. We, we have to engage, and we are part of God's plan. In fact, there's this principle I want us to grab hold of and learn today, because I think it's a principle that Jesus teaches these early apostles that was mission critical for them. And today, as we are invited to be part of the movement of God, it's mission critical for us. And that is this principle right here, that God's spirit in us is what empowers God's movement through us. Again, the spirit of God, mission critical to the mission of God, but so are his people. So are we. The movement of God happens in and through us. So after the resurrection, Jesus spends about 40 days. And in those 40 days before he ascends up into heaven, he has multiple conversations with these disciples and multiple interactions. And these disciples are like, okay, what's next? What's next? Like Jesus rose from the grave. That's miraculous. Wow. What is going to happen next? And they had a theory. So they would ask jesus they'd say lord has the time come is this the moment where you're going to free israel and restore our kingdom and we have to realize historically they had spent a little over 90 years under roman rule and oppression the roman empire treated them like dirt they would tax them really high they would treat them almost like slaves, if you will, definitely oppressing them and pushing them down in society. And so they were eager. They were looking forward to the day when no longer Rome would rule over them. And instead they would be established and become the political powerhouse that they once were. And so their thought was, hey, the Messiah, he's gonna be a political leader. He's gonna come on the scene, and he's going to free us from Roman oppression. He's going to restore our kingdom. This is great. And then Jesus is arrested. Not only arrested, but he's executed on a Roman cross of all things. So you can imagine how discouraged they were. I guess this isn't it. I guess he wasn't the Messiah. I guess we're not going to be freed. I guess we're going to continue to live in oppression and be beat down as a people. But then on the third day, and you remember this, he rose from the grave. And so in their mind, they're like, man, the resurrection, it inaugurates, it initiates the rebellion against Rome, the establishment of Israel. Once again, this is really, really exciting for them. And so they're asking Jesus, is this the time? Is it time for you to free us? Is it time for us to restore our kingdom? And they're sitting in a place with Jesus that day called the Mount of Olives. And a few months before, and I'm talking about maybe six months before, and it was before the death of Jesus, before the resurrection, while Jesus was still with them, they were in that same spot the mount of olives and in that same spot jesus had already told him he said look one day i'm going to return and i'm going to establish my kingdom my forever kingdom it's going to be amazing and so a few months before they were at that spot and they asked jesus when they were at that spot with him tell us when this is going to happen we want to know what signs what signals what should we be looking for that there's going to be your return and the end of the world? When are you going to do all this stuff? And they asked what many of us ask today, like when is Jesus returning? When is all this stuff going to happen? Because what they wanted to know, they wanted Jesus to tell them, Jesus, tell us about your victory and our reward. Your victory and our reward. We want to know what is our reward. And do you know, as a follower of Jesus Christ, there is an eternal reward waiting for you and I. In fact, one of Jesus's closest disciples, his name was John. He was known as John the Beloved. He was the brother of James. Some of y'all may remember this. Well, John wrote multiple of the historical documents that make up what we call the New Covenant or the New Testament. Well, he was the last contributing writer that we recognize as being inspired by the Spirit. And he wrote one of the last books of the Bible. In fact, in your Bible, it is found at the very end, the book of Revelation. And this is all about a vision that John experienced about what would come. And John describes in his vision our reward. As he sees the new heaven and the new earth, look what he says. He says, I hear this loud shout from the throne. And the voice is saying this, look, God's home is now among his people. He will live with them and they will be his people. God himself will be with them. He will live with them, and they will be his people. God himself will be with them. He will wipe away every tear. I love this. And guess what happens? No more death. No more sorrow. No more crying. No more pain. All these things are gone forever. This is the future. If you're a follower of Jesus, this is your future. He goes on, he says, and the one sitting on the floor, look, I'm making everything new, even you, a new body, a resurrected body. He says, and then he told John, write this stuff down. What I tell you is trustworthy. He said, it is finished. I am the beginning. I'm the end. I'm the alpha. I'm the omega. To all who are thirsty, I will freely give from the springs of the water of life. You will have eternal life. And all who are victorious will inherit all these blessings. I will be their God, and they, they will be my children. Do you know if you're a follower of Jesus, your reward is eternal. You are ultimately victorious. And you and I, as followers of Jesus, if that's where you are, you are entitled to all these blessings, these inheritances to be part of the kingdom of God. And so these disciples, it's not weird to think that they're looking forward to their future reward. And they're asking, is it time? Is it time? And I think what they're asking is the same thing I ask sometimes. When I'm just spending time with God, I'm asking, is it time yet for you to relieve my pain? Is it time yet for you to free Israel? Some of you, you're online today because you're going through some really tough stuff. And you're hoping maybe I say something, or you flip to another website and find another church that that person would say something. Or you're in this room because you're in a really hard spot. Life is not good. And your prayer and your hope is exactly this. Lord, is it time? Is this the day? Some of you are like, I'm not even worried. Is this the month? Is this the year? When is it going to stop? Maybe you're not in that category. Maybe you're like me. Sometimes you're like, is it time for me to receive my reward? Like I've worked hard to let God, when do we get our reward? I call these prayers a subtraction and addition. Think about how you pray and I pray. How many times are you asking God to take away that situation, take away that circumstance, take away that pain, or give me this situation? Lord, is it time? Is this the Sunday? Out in the lobby, am I going to see him? That's the man, right? Is this the time you're going to meet him? Is this the day you pray and you leave him? I don't know. I don't know which one, right? But we oftentimes pray this way, and that's what the disciples are thinking, right? Are you going to free Israel? Are you going to restore us? And I want you to watch what Jesus says. Watch how Jesus turns the conversation. He says this. He said, look, it's the Father who has authority to set those dates and those times. It's not for you to know. It's not information for you to know when I'm going to free Israel, when I'm going to restore your kingdom. But you, you, I want you to focus on something different. And that's hard. It's hard not to focus on our relief or our reward. But said, you, you, here's what I want you to know. I want you to know the reality that you are going to receive. And you can imagine the apostles are excited. Good, awesome. That's what I'm asking. Want to receive something, right? What am I going to receive? Power. That's great. We just asked you, Jesus, are we going to have our kingdom restored? When do I receive this power? When the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And imagine how excited they are. Remember, they had heard before, in a few days, we're going to be baptized by the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit comes upon us, we're going to receive power. This is awesome. And he goes on, he says, and you will. And again, what do you think they hoped would be the next sentence? What do you hope is the next sentence? What do I hope is the next sentence? Don't you hope that it's some kind of the Spirit of God's going to come, and when the Spirit of God comes upon us, it's going to bring us relief? It's going to bring us reward? Don't we hope that's the function, the immediate relief and reward? And Jesus starts to turn their focus not around their future relief or future reward, but on the eternal mission and movement of God. He says, you're going to need the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit's going to empower you to be my witnesses. What is a witness? You know this, a witness in a court of law does what? They just testify. This is what I saw. This is what I heard. They just testify, share their story. And these witnesses, what are these witnesses, what are we as witnesses going to do? We We're just gonna tell people about Jesus everywhere. The Spirit of God empowering the people of God to tell people about Jesus everywhere. And thus the movement begins. And he tells his disciples it's gonna move from Jerusalem to Judea to Samaria to the ends of the earth. God's Spirit inside of God's people, empowering them to accomplish God's mission and God's movement. Remember, God's Spirit in us is what empowers, empowers God's movement through us. Now, these are the last words that Luke records for us that Jesus spoke in the book of Acts. Because then, all of a sudden, after he said this, Jesus was taken up into a cloud. While they were watching, they could no longer see him. This, if you will, was Jesus' mic drop moment. What a way to end the conversation. You're going to receive power. You're going to be able to witness this everywhere I go. the conversation you're gonna receive power you're gonna be able witnesses everywhere i go fly straight up i mean it's crazy right and and this is the last thing because they're asking remember what they asked like are you gonna you're gonna free us you're gonna restore our kingdom you're gonna relieve our pain you're gonna gonna receive our reward like is this about to happen jesus and jesus says that's not for you to know. You, you just need to know the Holy Spirit's going to go upon you. And when he does, you're going to tell people about me everywhere you go. Watch how they respond. They strain to see him rising into heaven. Now, I want you to think about what they're focusing on. Not a bad thing. I mean, not many people have ever experienced somebody talking to you and then all of a sudden floating up, right? So it's not weird that they're staring up, but their focus in that moment is on Jesus and his mission. Man, Jesus, when are you going to come? I got to believe in my heart and my mind. They're still asking the same question. Okay. Like Jesus, you're the only one that can bring me relief. Jesus, you're the only one that can bring me relief Jesus you're the only one that can bring me an eternal reward and so they're staring up into the sky and then all of a sudden as they're doing that watch what happens to white-robed men suddenly stood among them who are these guys now we know scholars tell us these are angels and the reason you know is just the way that Luke words it he words it and he lets us know that they have white robes on. Now, just because you're wearing a white robe, you can't like walk in tonight and tell your wife, look, I'm an angel. I got a white robe. Like, but if you suddenly appear out of nowhere, it might be an angel. Anyway, that's what Luke's saying. These angels show up, and remember, an angel is simply a messenger of God. So what do the messengers of God come and say? They say, men of Galilee, why are you standing here staring at heaven? Why are you so focused on your future relief and future reward that you're going to miss the present movement? He said, all you need to remember and understand is Jesus has been taken away from you. That's not an easy statement to digest if you've spent three and a half years with this rabbi. He says, says but someday someday he will return from heaven just in the same way you saw him go up so again their information isn't very elaborate it's not very detailed they don't tell us when or where or how we don't we don't know right and i i think again the apostles are asking the same question i would ask as they're looking up in the sky jesus has the time come again for you to return from heaven? I know that's so many days of my life. It's a time come for you to bring relief, reward, rescue, whatever it might be. I think the angel's like, man, all you need to know is that he's coming back. He's coming back. But we're not going to tell you when. And I think in the words of Jesus, they would say, that's not for you to know. That's not your business. That's God's business, but you, you, you need to focus on the movement. Your mission is to tell people everywhere about me to the ends of the earth. God's spirit inside of God's people to be his witnesses, to tell people about him everywhere. Remember, remember, God's spirit in us is what empowers god's movement through us so if this is true if it is god's spirit that actually empowers us to go about god's mission and god's movement then we've got to ask this question how do we access the power of the holy spirit in our lives because if the Spirit of God is so mission critical to the movement of God, and the Spirit of God is what empowers the people of God, then we've got to ask and answer this question. So I want to give you three ways. It's not exclusively the only ways, but three ways you can experience the power of God in your life. Let me start with the first one. The first one is, if you want to experience the power of the Holy Spirit, then you need to pray in the Spirit. Here's how the Apostle Paul said it, pray in the Spirit at all times on every occasion. Now, what in the world does it mean to pray in the Spirit? Last week, we talked about this. It's important whenever reading Scripture to look at the context, context, context, right? What is the immediate context? What book of the Bible are we looking at? And you'll notice it says the book of Ephesians. Ephesians is a letter the apostle Paul wrote to followers of Jesus that lived in first century Ephesus. And in this context, he is talking to them about spiritual warfare. He says, man, a lot of the troubles you're dealing with, just realize it's not of this world. There's a spiritual layer to it. In fact, he describes it this way. He says, we're not fighting against flesh and blood enemies, but against the evil rules or rulers, excuse me, I forgot to spell it right. Rulers and authorities of the unseen world against the mighty powers in the dark world and against the evil spirits in the heavenly places. Again, I don't know what your background is you may read words like that and say man that's just weird i don't know but then some of you know it you've experienced it the stuff going on in your marriage is a little bit more than just communication issues the stuff that's going on in your family something's going on something going you're like man there is some kind of deeper level spiritual attack and the bible teaches this a reality. Much of the evil we see in the world, it's not flesh and blood, but it is against the mighty powers in the dark world. And I think we read that stuff and it weirds us out or freaks us out. And if we're not careful, we just retreat. We flee from it. But remember, we're called to be fearless followers of Jesus, not fearful. So Paul says in the next sentence, what we're going to do is we're going to fight. We're going to put on every piece of armor. So we're going to be able to stand and resist the enemy in the time of evil. Then after the battle, you will be standing firm. I don't know if you ever read the rest of this text, but he begins to rattle off parts of the armor that protect you and I. He says, put on the belt of truth, the thing that holds it all together, the truth of God's word, the truth of Jesus Christ being the only way to be made right. Put on the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, not just knowing the right things to do, but actually doing them. Live righteously, shoes fitted, ready for the gospel of peace, to advance the good news of the gospel to other places. He says, pick up the shield of faith. When you have that shield, you're able to extinguish the lies from the enemy, the darts, the flaming arrows that he's shooting at. He said, put on the helmet of salvation, and you're ready. You're ready for that attack. But he said, we don't just shrink back. No, we, as followers of Jesus, we advance. So we go on the offense. We actually pick up the sword of the Spirit. What is the sword of the Spirit? He says the sword of the Spirit is the Word of God. It's an offensive. It's a progressive, not regressive or reactive piece of the equipment. And we go to battle. We go to war. We don't retreat. We advance. And it's in that context that then Paul says this. Then pray in the Spirit. Not reactive, but proactive. Not retreating, but advancing at all times and on every occasion. What does it mean to be praying in the Spirit? It means to be led by the Spirit and directed by the Word. Do not forget that the Word of God is alive and powerful. It is sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword, cutting between soul and spirit, between joint and marrow. It exposes our innermost thoughts alive and powerful it is sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword cutting between soul and spirit between joint and marrow it exposes our innermost thoughts and desires when you and I begin to align our prayers align our conversation align our requests with God with the will of God and the Word of God there is great unstoppable power that is when you begin to experience the power of the Holy Spirit. So practically speaking, okay, dude, what does that look like? Well, I thought I'd tell you what it looks like for me. So whenever I am blessed and honored with being able to teach on a Sunday morning, I work hard, I prepare. And typically when I wake up on a Friday, within the first hour, I start to get really nervous and stressed. It's not just because of public speaking. Like, that is a little weird to have a bunch of people staring at you. I mean, many people, you've heard this on a survey, like, public speaking is like their top two worst fears, usually only behind death, right? And so there is that nervousness, but at the same time, I know what the Word of God says. James says, I stand a stricter judgment. So someday I'm gonna stand before God, judged for what I said and did not say. How did I direct the people of God, speaking on behalf of God, the will of God? And so there's a lot of weight. So I start getting nervous and stressed and overwhelmed. And it's in that moment that I've got to start to pray in the spirit. I've got to align my heart with God's heart. So I look in the Word of God, and I see texts like 1 Timothy 2, 4 that says, God our Savior wants everyone to be saved. Now I know, I know what the Word of God says. Jesus himself said, broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many people go that route. Narrow is the road that leads to life, and few go that route. So in other words, at any point in the history of the world, there's going to be more people that don't follow Jesus than do follow Jesus. But that doesn't change the heart of God. God still desires all people, everybody to be saved and understand the truth. What is the truth? That there is only one God. There's only one mediator who can reconcile or make you right with God. God and humanity can be reconciled through this mediator. Who is this mediator? Jesus Christ. So I start praying. God, I know your desire is that all people would know and walk with you, would connect with you for now and all eternity by faith in your son, Jesus Christ. But I also know what Jesus said. Jesus said, no one's going to come to me unless the father who sent me draws them. In other words, there's nothing I'm gonna ever say or do from this stage that's gonna convince someone to follow Jesus. So I remember yesterday, I'm mowing the lawn and I'm taking a left turn, didn't even hit a tree. It was awesome. And I'm praying for y'all and I'm praying for me. And I'm saying, God, if your spirit doesn't work, if you don't draw people to Jesus, no one will come to Jesus. So Jesus, give me the right words. Give me the right words. I don't know exactly what to say, what happens when I stutter or say something I shouldn't have said. You got to give me the right words. Help me be bold and explain the mysterious plan. That's mysterious. That means there's stuff that I don't know. Maybe I'll know it in a year from now. Maybe maybe I'll never know until I get to heaven there's questions I can't answer so I'm praying this that that people would know there's good news the gospel is not just for some people but for all people like help me God help me give me the right words and here's what's the strangest thing is I as I pray in the spirit aligned with the spirit aligned with God's word my nervousness changes and transforms to excitement and and my stress changes to anticipation and expectation all the sudden God begins to align my spirit with his spirit and all the sudden my will it gets aligned with his will, and there's great power in that. But here's the deal. We are not going to be able to pray in the spirit if we don't sharpen our swords. In other words, if you don't know the word of God, don't expect that you are able to pray in line with his will, his way, with his spirit. So we have to know the Word, pray the Word, and as we pray, led by the Spirit and directed by the Word, you will experience the power of the Holy Spirit in your life. The second way is to serve by the Spirit. What do I mean serve by the Spirit? That means serving God and serving others empowered and reliant upon God's power, not yours. The apostle Peter said it this way. He said, God has given each one of you a gift from his great variety of spiritual gifts. Use them well to serve one another. So the moment you come to know Christ, this moment you decide to follow Jesus, you receive the Holy Spirit. We talked about that last week. You are baptized, you are indwelt, you receive the Holy Spirit. The moment you receive the Holy Spirit we talked about that last week you are baptized you are indwelt you receive the Holy Spirit the moment you receive the Holy Spirit God gives with that spirit abilities God given abilities to do certain things really well empowered by the Spirit of God you may have one spiritual gift to three you're not gonna have all of them because we need one another so God's created it that we would be interdependent but you do have some kind of spiritual gift and the only way you're going to experience the power of God using your spiritual gift is when you actually use it, when you and I use it to serve one another. Now, as you look at spiritual gifts and study them in the New Testament, you're going to see they, most of the time they fall under one or two categories. There's speaking gifts and there's serving gifts. There's gifts that lean and are dependent upon words and gifts that are dependent upon works. Both, both are 100% empowered by God, empowered by the Holy Spirit. And this is what Peter says. He says, look, if you have one of those gifts of speaking, then speak as if God himself were speaking through you. In other words, depend on God's power to use that spiritual gift, that God-given ability. If it's serving, so if you've got these gifts of works or gifts of service, then do it as if it's from the strength that God provides you. Why? Why should we do that? He says, so that in everything you do, you will bring glory to God through Jesus Christ. You bring glory to God because the gift is not only given by God, but it is empowered by God. So he gets the credit, you don't get the credit. See if you want to experience, if you want to experience the power of God, discover your spiritual gift, develop your spiritual gift, start to use your spiritual gift, and you will experience the power of God speaking through you and serving through you in a miraculous and amazing way. Look, here's the deal. You will never experience the power of the Holy Spirit until you're in a position that you need the power of the Holy Spirit. And I don't know about you, but many times I navigate my life such that I don't put myself in a position that I can't do something that I know that I don't know how to do. I often manipulate circumstances, and I don't, I say, man, I know how to do this, so I'll volunteer for this, not for that. But I want to tell you something, and when you start stepping into how God has gifted you and empowered you, all of a sudden you get to be dependent and experience his power working in you and through you. There is a great difference between serving by your own power and serving by the power of the Holy Spirit. You want to experience the power of the Holy Spirit in your life? Start praying in the Spirit. Start serving in the Spirit. And finally, tell people about Jesus. I mean, this is what Jesus was saying. You're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And when that happens, you're going to tell people about Jesus. Now, here's the deal. If you and I refuse to tell people about Jesus, we should not expect to experience the power of the Holy Spirit. The power is in us, but the light switch is turned off. But you start telling people about jesus all of a sudden you'll experience his power you say well how do i position my life such that i'm telling people about jesus and i'm relying on his power not my own one of the best examples i can share with you is the apostle paul he went to a city called corinth and he said i'm going to be dependent upon the power of the holy spirit listen what he says to them he says, I'm going to be dependent upon the power of the Holy Spirit. Listen to what he says to them. He says, when I first came to you, dear brothers and sisters, I didn't use lofty words and impressive wisdom to tell you the mystery of God. I want to stop right there for a second. The mystery of God, I think, is one of the reasons you and I are nervous about talking to people about Jesus, because there is a mystery. There are certain things about God that are mysterious. And people try to act like or say they completely understand and all that kind of stuff. There is part of God, he is God, he is infinite, he is amazing. And there's parts of God that are mysterious. And you're probably worried like I am. What if they ask me a mysterious question? And you might have to say what I've learned to say, and I know this may sound crazy, but people are okay with this. You look them in the eyes and say, I don't know. I don't know. No one, my entire life, I don't know if people were just nice to me because I'm a pastor. No one ever gets mad at me or anything. Nine times out of 10, they say, hey, thanks for being honest about that. And when you begin to tell people about Jesus, relying upon the Holy Spirit, you're not trying to use lofty words and impressive wisdom. I think sometimes we feel that. We feel like, man, I got to say just the right thing and avoid saying the wrong thing. But Paul says, that's not what I did. Instead, what I did is I just forgot everything, all the mysteries, except for Jesus Christ. I just decided in my life, I'm going to tell people, you know what? There is this man from Nazareth. His name is Jesus. And he actually is God's son. And he was crucified. He died on the cross, not because he did anything wrong, but he died on the cross to take on your sin. He kept it simple. He just told them about Jesus. And so how did he do that? He said, well, I just came to you in weakness. What does that look like? Timid and trembling. I don't know about you. This may sound arrogant, but I can do this. And so can you. We can tell people about Jesus in weakness and humility and fear and trembling. So what it results in, our message and our preaching isn't very elaborate. It's very plain. In other words, I'm not going to tell you everything you need to know about Jesus, but I can tell you what I know. I can tell you what I've experienced. I'm not going to come at you with clever and persuasive speeches. I think so many times we think, man, if I tell people about Jesus, I got to sell Jesus. I got to make sure I say it right. I don't want them to die and go to hell. It's all dependent on me. And Paul said, that's not how I operate. In fact, I operate in such a way that I rely on the power of what? What do you think this is? The Holy Spirit. Not on the power of a degree, not on the power of experience, not on the power of eloquent speech, not on the power of whatever you're going to put in that blank. He says on the power of the Holy Spirit. And the reason he does this is because I don't want people to put trust in human wisdom. Like if you come to know Jesus and you decide to follow Jesus because I somehow wisely communicated that, I would probably argue you're not really following Jesus. He says, I don't want people to be dependent upon my human wisdom. Instead, I want them to be dependent upon the power of God. Paul said, I'm unashamed of the gospel for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and then the Gentiles. Let me tell you something. You want to experience the power of God in your life, start telling people about Jesus. It's scary. You may not know what to say, but just say, all right, I've decided I'm not gonna be clever. I'm not gonna be persuasive. I'm not gonna use lofty words. I'm just gonna keep it plain and simple. And you just trust God to work. You just say, God, you use me. Man, when we begin to do things like this, praying and serving and telling, you begin to experience the power of the Holy Spirit in your life. And remember, God's Spirit in us, what? Empowers God's movement through us. God's movement starts with God's Spirit. So we're desperately dependent upon His Spirit to work in us and through us. That's why Jesus said, you're going to receive power. When the Holy Spirit comes upon you, you'll know, you'll know because you're going to become my witnesses. What does that mean? You're going to tell people about me everywhere. All of a sudden, the Spirit of God empowering the people of God to begin and initiate the movement of God. It may start off small in your home, and all of a sudden you're praying for your spouse, you're talking to your kids, whatever it might be, and you may not know all the answers. It's humbling to sit in front of a four-year-old who asks you a question, and you're just like, man, I don't know. But I know this, I love you, and God loves you. So much that he would send his only son. Little Johnny, like, I wouldn't give up my son. I wouldn't give up you for anybody. So that tell you how much God loves you. And you start to keep it plain. You start to keep it simple. And all of a sudden, what's happening in your home, it eventually overflows from work. All of a sudden, you're praying for people at work, people that you work with. And I'm not talking about walking up to them. Let me pray for you. You know, that kind of thing that freaks people out. That's how you do. You're weird, man. You're just weird. But you know what? On the way to work, you can start praying for people. Whatever's going on in Bill's life, the struggles he's dealing with, you start praying and say, God, I think, I'm starting to think you're the answer. You're the answer to what he's going through. God, would you work in his life god would you use me you pray prayer like that volunteer volunteer to be used by god all of a sudden you're going to school not just to learn but all of a sudden it's a mission field you're sitting around that lunch table and and it's not about just seeing how many tater tots you can steal without the other guy seeing man you you see it as an opportunity the spirit of god working in you and through you. All of a sudden, your neighborhood is not just where you live. I believe with all my heart, God's put you in that apartment complex. Even if you only got three more months left on that lease, you are there for an eternal reason. God has put you there. All of a sudden, we're going throughout our community, playing softball, golf, shopping, whatever we do, empowered by the Spirit of God as a part of the movement of God. It affects then our city, our state, our country, and eventually to the ends of the earth. The Spirit of God empowering the people of God. I love what the Apostle Paul says about his own life. He says, look, when I look at my life, my life is worth nothing to me. It's useless unless I use it to finish the task assigned to me by the Lord Jesus Christ. What task are you talking about, Paul? The task of telling the others the good news about the wonderful grace of God. I would tell you, Fearless Church, the same could be said about us. We're worth nothing. Are we just going to be a country club? Like, is that our goal, that we become a social club? It's us for and no more. We come here, we love each other, but we don't care about the city, the community, the neighborhood, the school, the people we work with. We don't care. Or, or do we say, no, God's changed us. He's put his spirit in us for more than just immediate relief and reward. He's put his spirit in us for eternal mission and movement do we say no God's given us a task and that task is acts 1 8 task well we're telling others the good news about the wonderful grace of God the good news about Jesus see God's Spirit in us empowers what? God's movement through us. This was such an important principle for those first century apostles to understand. Can you imagine? Jesus is like, I'm leaving. It's all dependent upon you. Oh, so God is leaving us and we're supposed to continue this thing. And Jesus is like, don't worry. Don't worry don't worry because i'm about to give you my spirit and when my spirit is inside of you you will have power to be on mission you will have power to be my witnesses in jerusalem judea samaria in your home at work neighbor wherever you will be empowered to move the gospel to the ends of the earth. The first century followers of Jesus needed to know that. And today, today, we as 21st century followers of Jesus, we need to know this as well. God has entrusted us with this movement, and he's empowered us by his spirit. May we be found in our generation faithful not to sit on the sidelines, not to keep our mouth shut, but boldly, even though it may be plain and simple and not persuasive, but to boldly proclaim the good news about the wonderful grace of God to our generation, from our houses, to the streets, and beyond, to the ends of the earth. Let's pray. God, I pray that you would empower us. You've given us your spirit, not just to bring immediate comfort or immediate reward, but instead you've given us your spirit for eternal mission and movement. You've entrusted us with this movement, so Lord, help us be found faithful, empowered by your spirit to join this movement and continue it in the 21st century. God, we love you and pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen"}]}

Maybe miraculous, supernatural. They tell you a story, whether they're having coffee with you one-on-one, or it's in a community group, or maybe in a room like this, somebody's standing on stage. Maybe you see the story while you're watching online. Something amazing. Like, you online something amazing like what what's your response how do you respond to the unexplainable things that god is doing or has done in somebody else's life i mean do you get excited do you get encouraged inspired motivated does it push you propel you in your faith journey do you get jealous you think man why god like why over there in that situation, it appears you're doing miraculous, amazing, even some weird stuff. But in my life, it just doesn't seem that way at all. Or do you get skeptical? I don't know. Like, I think you might just be crazy. That's what's happened. Like that didn't happen, right? As I've grown up in church and had an opportunity to serve in church leadership, I've noticed when we begin to share and hear stories of the supernatural, of the amazing, of the miraculous, even the weird, most people kind of fall in one of two categories. Maybe you're in the first category and you hear something like that and it moves you. You say, you know what? And I'm talking more than just entertains or engages you in the story. It moves you, it pushes you, it propels you in your relationship with Christ. Maybe you have no relationship with Jesus, but you hear something and you're like, I think whatever my next step is, I'm willing to take it. Or maybe you're very strong in your faith and you say, man, I heard that and that inspired me to take another greater faith step. It moves you. But for others, when we hear the story, our response is to mock them. Maybe we make fun or maybe we dismiss, whatever it may be. We're like, I don't know. And I want you to know throughout the history, as people have experienced the mighty movement of God, they've been responding in one of these two ways. It's no different. The day that the Holy Spirit of God fell down and came upon followers of Jesus Christ, it was a day where some amazing things happened, some miraculous things happened, some weird stuff happened. And just like then, those that were there, those that watched, those that saw what was going on had one of two responses. Either they were moved by it or they mocked it. So my question is for you and me, when we experience something weird, something amazing, something miraculous in our own lives, will we be moved by it or will we mock it? So let's check out what they did. It started on the day of Pentecost. Now, Pentecost was a Jewish celebration, a festival. It is one of three pilgrimage festivals. And what that means is if you were a Jew and you did not live in Jerusalem, you did whatever it took to get to Jerusalem to celebrate this particular feast, this particular festival. It took place 50 days after Passover. So you'd celebrate Passover, so you'd stay in Jerusalem for 50 days. So that's what, seven or eight weeks, right? And then you would celebrate Pentecost. And Pentecost would recognize and celebrate the first fruits of the wheat harvest. And so it was a celebration to say, man, God is our provider. He's provided for us. We will bring offerings, the first fruits to celebrate that. Later in Jewish history, it became a celebration and a recognition of when God brought the law to his people through the prophet Moses. So you kind of, some of you might remember that story. Moses goes up on Mount Sinai. He has this amazing supernatural experience, comes down with the tablets, right? The law of God. And so they would recognize and remember that. So it's the day of Pentecost. And on the day of Pentecost, all the believers, and what that's talking about is the followers of Jesus. Those who were committed to the person of Jesus Christ. They were meeting together in one place. Now, Luke had already told us a little bit about what their meetings were like. In fact, in Acts chapter one, he describes the reality that they would go upstairs in the room of the house they were all staying at, and then they would meet together, and they were constantly united in prayer. During this time, there were about 120 believers together in one place. And so it might've been similar to something like this. A large room, they're having a time of worship, a time of prayer. They're recognizing the celebration of the first fruits. They're recognizing the celebration of God giving his law. And it's in that setting that all of a sudden a sound from heaven, like the roaring of a mighty windstorm. And it fell in the house, or it filled, excuse me, the house where they were sitting. And then what looked like flames or tongues of fire appeared and settled on each of them. This was one of those worship services you did not wanna miss. I mean, it was crazy. And without a doubt, you read those words and I don't know what category you fall in. I think probably the majority of us are like, yeah, I think that legitimately happened. You might be in a mock them category. You're like, yeah, whatever. That's symbolic that it happened. But this happened, this supernatural event where they experienced the power and presence of God in a way they never had before. And then, then it happened. They were filled with the Holy Spirit. Everything changed in one moment. Now, when Luke writes this phrase filled with the Holy Spirit Spirit, you're gonna see it throughout the book of Acts. And what he's referring to is two different things. Number one, he'll oftentimes say filled with the Holy Spirit in talking about the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. So in other words, when somebody commits their life to Jesus Christ, to follow him, they receive the Holy Spirit, they are baptized in the Holy Spirit. But he also refers to being filled with the Holy Spirit as when the Holy Spirit empowers the person, empowers them, giving them supernatural ability to do something they may not have been able to do before, specifically empowers them to share the story of Jesus, empowers them to proclaim the gospel. In this case, they were filled with the Holy Spirit, both were true. They were indwelled with the Spirit in this moment and they were empowered by the Spirit. And remember, the Spirit of God empowered them to do what? To begin to speak in other languages. Your translation may say to speak in tongues. The Spirit of God enabled them to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ in languages they didn't already know. And this ability wasn't based on their education, it wasn't based on their experience, wasn't based on their ability. Luke tells us, no, the Holy Spirit gave them this ability, the ability to speak a language that they didn't even know, maybe have never even heard of. So the question has to become, why that? Out of all the things the Spirit of God could have enabled and empowered his people to do, why give them the ability to speak in other languages? So to be able to answer that question, Luke continues in the story and gives us a little background on what was happening. He says this, he says, at the time, there were devout Jews from every nation staying in Jerusalem. Remember, they had arrived there probably seven or eight weeks before to celebrate Passover. Now here it is, 50 days later, they're celebrating Pentecost. And so they're from all over the regions, all over different nations. They had gathered there and watch what happens. When they heard the loud noise, everyone came running. Remember, there was a sound from heaven like a mighty windstorm. And so for whatever reason, and we don't know what exactly it sounded like, I would imagine it sounded like a tornado or maybe a hurricane, something enough to get their attention, but it didn't scare the people. Instead, it drew the people. There was a curiosity. What is that sound? I gotta go check it out. And so they show up and they are bewildered. Another translation there is they are confused, not by the loud sound. What are they confused by? What are they bewildered by? The reality that they're beginning to hear in their own languages. And these languages are being spoken by these followers of Jesus. And they're amazed by that. In fact, Luke continues and says, they're completely shocked. They're completely amazed. How can this be? Explain, these people are all from Galilee. From Galilee is a bunch of redneck farmers and fishermen. Like how do these dudes know how to speak a different language? How do these ladies know how to speak? They're not highly educated, they're not political leaders. What in the world is going on? Because we're hearing things in our own native language. Luke continues on and he rattles off. He says, here we are. And he rattles off all these people from Mesopotamia, from Asia, from some of these I can't pronounce, Rome. I can do that one, right? And he's got all these different, 15 different, he says, all these different places we've come from, yet we're hearing, we're hearing about the wonderful things God has done in our own language. What are the wonderful things God has done? Imagine, these believers are telling them the story about God's provision of the anointed one, the Messiah. This rabbi from Nazareth named Jesus is not some normal everyday rabbi. Instead, they're sharing with him, man, this is what we saw. This is what we've seen. This is what we've heard. It's been some amazing, miraculous thing. He died on the cross and it was crazy. We were discouraged. And then he rose three days later and here's, and they're telling him all these wonderful things in their own language. And Jesus, 10 days before this happened, just 10 days before this happened, Jesus predicted it. He said, look, when you are going to receive power, like when the Holy Spirit comes down upon you and you experience that, you're gonna receive power. And what's gonna happen is you're gonna be my witnesses. In other words, you're gonna start sharing what you've seen and heard. And this empowerment, this movement, it's going to begin in Jerusalem. And so empowerment, this movement, it's going to begin in Jerusalem. And so imagine, put yourself in their shoes. You're hanging out in Jerusalem. Maybe you had done so for 30 years of your life and you're there with your wife and kids and you're celebrating Pentecost, reminding yourself and your family that God is your ultimate provider, reminding yourself and your family that you're connected to God by his law and you're God's chosen people, the Jews, and you're excited and all of a sudden you hear this huge tornado sound. And you see those staying in the house next to you and over here and everybody's starting to run to this part of town and you run over there and all of a sudden there are these common, everyday people like you and me speaking and sharing the good news, the story of Jesus in your own language. And in that moment, in that moment, people responded in one of two ways. Some people were amazed and perplexed. They're like, what in the world is going on? And other people, other people ridiculed and perplexed. They're like, what in the world is going on? And other people, other people ridiculed, they mocked. Some were moved, some mocked. Those that were moved, they asked this question, what can this mean? And they're not asking the question about what does the windstorm mean? What are the flames, tongues of fire? Because I don't even know if they saw that. Maybe that's just what the 120 saw and experienced in the room, but they definitely are asking the question, what can it mean that they're speaking in so many different languages? In my language, in their language, what does that mean? I think the day of Pentecost is not just the moment when followers of Jesus received the Holy Spirit, but it's the moment, the first day when God began to fulfill a promise he had made some 2,000 years before. See, I think the movement began not just in this moment, but I think it began 2,000 years before when God had a conversation with a man by the name of Abram. Listen to what he said. He said, Abram, I want you to leave your country and just realize this, when it comes to a relationship with God, God is always gonna move you to the next step. It's not about staying complacent, uncomfortable, familiar, safe. It's God always moving. He says, I want you to leave your relatives, your father's family. That's difficult, that's challenging. Go to the land that I'll show you. Some of you recognize that. He's about the land of Canaan known as in the Bible as the go to the promised land. And this is land you're gonna inherit. Today, it would be modern day Israel and Palestine, some of that major region. This was the land that God was promising. And then he makes this promise, this promise that forever changed our world. Again, what we're reading is 2,000 years before this celebration of Pentecost, 2,000 years before the Holy Spirit comes down. And here's the promise. He says, I'm going to make you into a great nation. In fact, if you want to hear the story or you want to read the story, the first five books of the Bible, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy are known as the Torah or the law. And it also reveals to us the history, the history of God's fulfillment of this promise, where Abraham has a son who also has another son who has 12 sons and they end up as a family in Egypt and they grow underneath the hand of slavery. All these amazing God gives a lot of these people. You can hear the amazing history and story ultimately culminating into reality, this great nation known as the nation of Israel. God makes this promise. He continues on. He says, look, I'm going to bless you and make you famous. This is from the first book of the Bible known as Genesis. And that means just the beginnings, right? Genesis chapter 12. If you read in Genesis chapter 17, you would hear another similar conversation that God has with Abram. In fact, God changes his name. Abram means exalted father. And he says, I'm gonna change your name from Abram to Abraham, meaning father of multitudes. And the reality is God fulfilled that promise. Almost every nation you go to to this day. In fact, many of you, even if you don't have a Bible background or church background, you've heard the name Abraham. Abraham is a famous name. God fulfilled his promise among not just Jewish people, among the nation Israel, but also Gentiles, people that are not Jews. They recognize the name of Abraham. And he continues on and he says, and here's what's gonna happen. You will be a blessing to others. So this promise that I'm making with you today is not just for you, it's gonna extend beyond you to the generations, to your descendants that will follow after you. And then God promises to protect Abram and this nation. He says, I'm gonna bless those who bless you and I'll curse those who treat you with contempt. And then he says this, he said, Abram, this promise that I'm making with you is not just for you. It's not just for your family. It's not just for your lineage. It's not just for your nation. And he makes this promise. He says, no, this promise is the reality that all the families on earth will be blessed through you. Fast forward 2,000 years later, the apostle Paul is explaining this promise that God made with Abraham. Listen to what he says. He said, God proclaimed the good news to Abraham. Long ago when he said all the nations, all peoples, all families will be blessed through you. What is the good news? That through Jesus Christ, God has blessed the Gentiles. Through Jesus Christ, God has fulfilled the promise he made in Genesis 12, verse three. When he said all the families are gonna be blessed, all the families will experience the same blessing that he promised Abraham. So that we who are believers might receive the promised Holy Spirit. How do we receive the promised Holy Spirit? Through faith. Through faith in who? Jesus Christ. See, when the Holy Spirit came down on the day of Pentecost, that was the moment when the church and the world begin to realize God's promise is not just for some people, it's for all people. It's not just the Jews, it's for Jews and Gentiles alike. This is why the apostle Paul says, \"'There's no longer Jew or Gentile, \"'no longer slave or free, no longer male or female, \"'for you are all one in Christ Jesus.'\" What does this mean? It means that we belong to Christ. And if we belong to Christ, then what? We're true children of Abraham. You are his heirs. And God's promise to Abraham belongs to you. So what this means is on the day of Pentecost, God's spirit empowered God's people to fulfill God's promise. That same promise he made 2000 years before to Abram that says, I'm gonna bless you. I'm gonna make your name famous. I'm going to bless all the families on earth for a promise made to one man that became a promise for all the world on earth for a promise made to one man that became a promise for all the world. A promise that salvation, salvation is available to all people. Doesn't matter where you've been, doesn't matter your nationality, doesn't matter what you're going through. It is available to all people through Jesus Christ. Now this is what happened on the day of Pentecost. You fast forward about 60 years and there's a guy named John, the Apostle John. Many of you probably recognize that name. He was the brother with James and John, the sons of Zebedee. He's known as the beloved disciple. Well, he endures great persecution, and he ends up exiled on the island of Patmos, and he has this encounter with God that is supernatural. And in the midst of this encounter, he has a vision of what one day will be. He writes down this vision in the book of Revelation. And part of the vision that he said, he saw, he saw what one day will be a reality. Watch what he says. He says, I saw a vast crowd, too great to count from only the nation Israel. No. What does he say? From every nation, from every tribe, from every people, from every language, is this sounding familiar? Every single language, they were standing in front of the throne before the lamb. They were clothed in white robes, palm branches in their hands, and they're shouting out and proclaiming from their nation, from their language, salvation comes not from our works, it comes from God. And how did God bring it to us? From the lamb, who is the lamb? Jesus Christ. In every language, every nation, every tongue. So when the people are asking, what can this mean? Why all these languages? Why is God empowering these people to speak in our own tongue? The answer is this, that God's spirit empowers God's people to fulfill his promise. What promise is that? To include all nations in the kingdom of God. This is why Jesus said near the end of his life, the good news about the kingdom, it's got to be preached throughout the entire world. So why? So all the nations will hear it and then the end will come. God's heart is for all people, not just some people. God's heart is for all people, not just some people. The day of Pentecost is that revelation that God is beginning to fulfill his promise that he made to Abraham 2000 years before. This promise, this desire that all people would come to know Jesus. Today, missiologists, people that are experts in looking and studying and navigating the stats and data and statistics about where the good news and the story of Jesus has been spread, tell us 60% of the world has either heard the gospel or is positioned among a people group that could hear the gospel even today, while 40% is not. About 40% of the world's population, three billion people, they live among people that have never heard the gospel. Now, you might be discouraged by that number, or you might say, look, it started from Jerusalem and it's now spread 60% of the globe's population now here, but the mission is not done. God desires, and remember what Jesus said. He said, I'm commanding you, commissioning you. The spirit of God is empowering you to go make disciples of who? All nations. God's heart is for everybody, not just few believers, not just the Jews, but for the Gentiles alike. And this story, the day of Pentecost is not so much about what happened, the wind, the fire, the tongues, it's more about why it happened. It happened to reveal to us the fire, the tongues. It's more about why it happened. It happened to reveal to us the heart of God. It happened to reveal to us that God desires all people, all people everywhere to hear the story of Jesus in their own tongue, in their own language, among their own people group. The day of Pentecost was the first day of God's fulfillment of his promise to Abraham so remember the first group of people they're amazed they're perplexed they're leaning in they're asking what can this mean we want to know more why so many languages but the second group remember the second group did what they ridiculed them they came to the conclusion you know what's happening they're just drunk yeah I don't know when the last time you were drunk. If you have a headache today, it might be because it was last night. So wake up, right? Or maybe you've been with somebody who's drunk. I can tell you this. I've never been around somebody that is just lit, that starts telling me the good news of Jesus Christ in a language they didn't already know. If if you've experienced that, I would love to hear about it. It'd be awesome. Most people, I'm not even sure if they know a language. If you're really like 2.30 in the morning, you've been drinking a long time, it's like, I don't even know if what you said was words. And why would somebody ride a pink rabbit to work? That sounds really weird, right? You say crazy stuff. And that's the conclusion they came up with. So why do and mock the movement of God. Why is it when God moves in and among his people, some people respond, and maybe you're one of those people, by ridiculing, by mocking. I think the apostle Paul would instruct followers in Corinth, and he'd say, look, you've gotta keep this thing in perspective. Don't forget that the message of the cross, the story of Jesus, it's foolish to those who are headed for destruction. But we who are being saved know it is the very power of God. He continues on, he says, remember where you came from, dear brothers and sisters, few of you were wise in the world's eyes or powerful or wealthy when God called you. And remember, what did they say? When they heard the sound, when they rushed in, when they heard all the different languages, remember what they said? When they heard the sound, when they rushed in, when they heard all the different languages, remember what they said? They said, how can this be? These people are only from Galilee. Farmers, fishermen, it's impossible. They're not wise. They're not powerful. They're not wealthy. They're not politically connected. How can they even know these languages? And Paul explains, he said, here's the reality. God chooses the things in the world that the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they're wise. And he chooses things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful. I think for some of you, you think, man, God can't use somebody like me. Like I don't have enough degrees. I don't have enough experiences. I don't have this. And you would say, when it comes to the things of God, I think I meet a lot of people that say, man, I feel like I'm in this category. Great. Those are the type of people God uses. In fact, it's actually pride that gets you in trouble. Pride's what trips you up, comes before the fall. But anybody who humbles himself for the Lord is exalted or lifted up. It doesn't matter that they're powerless. See, these guys came to the conclusion. They a bunch of people that are foolish. Here's a bunch of people that are weak. So they must be drunk. That's what they kind of come up to. Here's the reality. The foolish plan of God is wiser than the wisest human plan. You may look at God's plan to take common everyday people like you and me, put his spirit in us and entrust us and empower us to go sin out. I mean, you may say that looks foolish and God says, no, no, no. It's wiser than any kind of plan. It's stronger than what you might see in any human strength. So Paul says, so what do we do? What do we do with those that are the philosophers, the scholars, the world's brilliant debaters, those people that know a lot, when they experience the mighty movement of God, And it's their watching and it's their astounded and amazed. What did they come up with? They're just drunk. Again, it's foolish, right? Paul says, of course it's foolish because God's made the wisdom of this world look foolish. So what about you? What about you? When you experience the mighty movement of God, maybe it's through something in somebody else's life, movement of god maybe it's through something in somebody else's life a story maybe it's something you're seeing god do whatever it might be how do you respond the movement of god in your own life does it does it move you or do you mock it remember there was one miraculous fulfillment of god's promise that day but there were two responses. Some were moved, some mocked. I started to think, what does it look like to mock? Mock the movement of God, to mock the people of God, to mock people moved by God. I think first you have to do what they did. I think you have to dismiss the story. Remember, they just said, hey, they're drunk. Like, this is not God. Just something weird has happened so I'm gonna explain it away in my own words and I think eventually and maybe you're in this seat maybe you're watching online and maybe maybe you're just you you really care about somebody who invited you and you're listening to me talk and you're like man I don't believe any of that stuff happened and and the person who brought you keeps bringing up Jesus and you're just trying to shut them up and so that's why you're here honestly and you're thinking, man, I hope you quit talking because they're gonna bring up what you're saying right now at lunch and it's gonna be awkward. But you're thinking in your mind, if this doesn't stop, I've got to disengage from this person. And that happened to Jesus. Like Jesus would talk to those that were even interested in maybe following him. And he said to them, he said, look, the spirit alone is the one who gives eternal life. In fact, human effort accomplishes nothing. It's not about a bunch of religious activities and actions. He says, and the words that I've spoken, you need to realize there's spirit and life. And imagine hearing Jesus himself speak and look how the people responded. They turned away and they deserted him. See, if you choose to mock the movement of God, then you gotta dismiss the story. You gotta disengage from the people or the person telling you that story. But what if you didn't mock the movement? What if instead the movement moved you? What would it look like for what God is doing in and around the lives of people that you interact with? What would it look like for us as a church to experience the movement of God? I think we take movements. We don't lean back, we take a step in. What did they do? First of all, you start asking questions. What did they do? They're asking. I'm perplexed, I'm confused, bewildered, I'm amazed. What can this mean? Why so many languages? And they would begin to ask. God provided an answer. In fact, we're gonna look at this more next week, but Peter stepped forward with the 11 other apostles and he shouted, listen carefully. See, people that respond to the movement of God by moving and stepping towards God, they ask questions and they listen carefully. And as these people listened carefully, and again, you gotta log on next week, come back next week, we'll talk about all the things that Peter said next week, but they listened and then they asked more questions. As they listened, Peter's words pierced their hearts and they said to him and the other apostles, brothers, what should we do? How do we respond? And we shouldn't be surprised. Peter said, when you experience the movement of God and he moves, then you move. So he tells them, he says, each of you move, repent, change, turn away from the life you're living now and turn to God. And when you turn to God, you're baptized, you're identifying yourself with his son, Jesus. And that's when you experience God's forgiveness. And then you'll receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. You move, God moves. God moves, you move. Are you stepping towards? Draw near to God and hear draw, he will draw near to you. See, people that respond to the movement of God by moving, they ask questions and they make decisions. So that particular day, these people that respond to the movement of God by moving, they ask questions and they make decisions. So that particular day, these people that start off, what can this mean? Brothers, what shall we do? They respond and it says that those who believed what Peter said, all the things Peter was telling about who Jesus is and what he's done and who they are and how they are to respond, they believed it. And they were baptized that day, and that day added to the church. They respond and you say, well, man, I'm not ready to make that kind of decision, dude. Like I, I mean, some of the stuff I read in the Bible, some of the stuff you guys say that God has done in your life, I'm not ready to believe and be baptized, but you can, you can move. You can ask questions, you can make decisions. I mean, what if you kept it real simple? What if you said, hey, I'm coming back next Sunday. Like you guys tell me you're gonna talk more about what Peter said and how he responded when asked, how do we understand this? What can this mean? We're gonna look at what Peter said to all the people there that particular day. And if you wanna prepare and you wanna take a step farther, I would say, read Acts chapter two. That's what we looked at a little bit today. We're gonna look at it more next week. And then two weeks from now, we're gonna look at it again on October 8th. So you just read it maybe once this week, maybe once a day. And you just take a notebook and you start asking questions, write down your different questions. The question that we all have to ask ourselves is when we experience the mighty movement of God, when we experience things that are weird, amazing, miraculous, supernatural, how will we respond? Will it move you or will you mock them? What if this time you didn't mock? What if this time you didn't excuse it? What if this time instead of mocking you moved? Like as we walk through the book of Acts, we're going to read some amazing, miraculous, unexplainable things. And I think for some of us, maybe even honestly for me, you would say, I wouldn't mock that, I believe it happened. But we mock it in the sense that we limit it to that time and space. We say, well, that's an ax. That's the first generation. Like that can't happen in my life. That can't happen among us. And before we know it, we're mocking the movement of God. And what if we didn't mock it? That's the first generation. Like that can't happen in my life. That can't happen among us. And before we know it, we're mocking the movement of God. And what if we didn't mock it? What if we decided to join it? What if we decided to allow God's movement, God's spirit, what he's doing to fulfill his promise to move us? See, when it comes to the mighty movement of God, we can mock it or we can allow the movement to move us. Which will it be? Will it move you or will you mock it? Let's pray. Heavenly Father, I pray that we will be open to what you want to do in and among our church family. Lord, you did some amazing things that day, revealing your heart and your desire is that you desire all people, all people to be blessed through you, through your son, Jesus Christ, all people to come to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, not just to know some information, but to have salvation, transformation. And Lord, I pray we would be a church that our heart would reflect your heart. And God, we would see the supernatural things you've done, not just what you did, but why you did it. And God, that we would know our why and we would go out from this place doing whatever we can, not to mock you, but to be moved by you. So Lord, move in us, move through us. Lord, we're excited in the days and weeks ahead to join and be part of your movement. We love you. We trust you. We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen."}]}

Life is really hard sometimes. We've got DoorDash, we got Instacart, we got movies and music on demand. We get what we want when we want it, right? right and we can laugh about these things these are trivial little things we can laugh about those but you know as well as i do that your life is made up of some really consequential things some things where you desperately want an answer you pray to god and you think man god i need you to intervene i need your direction and it seems like god falls silent like you're just talking to dead air where is god i need him to speak into this, but where is he? What are we supposed to do with unanswered prayer? It's not like, there's no prayer tracking website. You know, I can track packages. I can't go online and be like, all right, good. As soon as I prayed, God received the prayer and it's scheduled to be fulfilled no later than Tuesday, December 5th, thank the Lord. I wish it worked that way, but it doesn't work that way What are we supposed to do when it seems like God is silent? A few years ago, my wife was diagnosed with MS, multiple sclerosis, and if I'm being honest, it's been a hard season for us. It's been a difficult thing to just grapple with, to cope with what this might mean for us in the future. We don't know. It's such a varied disease. Lesions pop up on different parts of the brain, and depending on where they pop up, they might cause different disabilities. It might be different levels of severity. It's hard to brace yourself for it because it's unknown. And so we've gone to God in prayer, and so many of you have prayed along with us and were grateful for it. Like, I believe prayer matters. So at the beginning, we go to God with big faith prayers. We get that part. And then the end of prayer, we love the end when God did a miracle. I see that God was working it all out the whole time. God really came through the end. We love that. But what about the in-between? The in-between, when you're not seeing results, that's where we're stuck. We're stuck right now in the in-between. And it's hard to pray in the in-between because you don't see immediate results all the time. And sometimes it does feel like you're praying to no one. Is not even listening to me. For us, it's been hard because you don't wanna always get your hopes back up and run the same cycle again. My wife came to me in tears like months and months ago, but she has an eye problem that comes with her MS, a symptom that causes some vision impairment, and the symptom had gone away. And during that season, she was praying prayers of big faith. God, I know you can heal me. I believe you will heal me. And then she comes to me in tears because the symptom came back. She's saying, you know, maybe it sounds dumb, but I thought God had done it. I thought I was a walking miracle. I thought I was healed. And now we gotta run this cycle again. It's hard to get back up again and keep praying when you don't see the results, when you're stuck in the in-between. And I know some of you are stuck there too. You've prayed for healing and it hasn't come. You've prayed for a relationship to be restored, but it's still broken. You've prayed for a breakthrough at work, but it hasn't come. You're still stuck. You've prayed for a spouse, but you're still single. You've prayed for a wayward child to come back into the fold, but they seem like they're long gone. You've prayed for an addiction to break, but it just holds on. What are we supposed to do in the middle, in the in-between? What are we supposed to do with unanswered prayer? We're starting a new sermon series today. It's called Christmas Carols, and each week we're going to break down the lyrics of a Christmas song. Today, the Christmas song is O Come, O Come, Emmanuel. We just sang it a few minutes ago ago and the context of this song is the in-between it's written about the 400 years of silence between the old testament and the new testament 400 years guys 400 years where is God in this there's no prophets speaking the word of God it feels like they're crying out to him the Israelites are crying out they're oppressed and it's like where is God in all of this world events keep happening they're oppressed, and it's like, where is God in all of this? World events keep happening. They're fulfilling Old Testament prophecy about a Messiah who would come, a Savior who would come, and they're looking forward to it. They're waiting and hoping, and yet silence. They're desperate and they're oppressed, and yet silence. People are born and die in the middle of the silence, 400 years of it. It's a really uplifting, fun family Christmas carol. I went first in the sermons here. I could have picked anything I wanted. I could have picked joy to the world. I could have picked grandma got run over by a reindeer. We could have had fun today. I think this one's important though. It is gonna be a heavy message, but I think it's an important message because it's where we live. But I think it's an important message because it's where we live. A lot of us live in the middle of the in-between. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put some lyrics to this song up. We're gonna start with lyrics and toward the end, we're gonna finish with lyrics. And I've translated these lyrics into what is sort of a prayer of waiting, an unanswered prayer, a prayer of desperation. So the song says, oh come, oh come, Emmanuel. emmanuel it's like saying god i need you to come through emmanuel that's that means god with us right i need to know that you're with me where are you i don't feel like you're with me i need you god come on come emmanuel and ransom captive israel i'm stuck i'm desperate here i can't do this without you i can't get out of this on my own i don't know what to do i don't know where to turn i'm mourning in lonely exile here it's like like, I'm hurting. I feel like I'm alone. I feel like I've been exiled from your presence. Like you don't even listen to me when I pray. Where are you, God? And I'm going to be stuck like this with no hope until the son of God appears, until Jesus comes through, because I don't have anybody else to turn to. On some level, God, I know that you're the answer to this problem, but I don't know where you're at in all of this. Where are you, God? Why don't you answer me? Have you ever felt like that? Have you ever prayed prayers where you wonder if God's listening? Have you ever felt alone? Have you ever felt desperate? I know that you have. I know many of you feel that way now. And I wanna put a disclaimer at the beginning of the message it's this i don't want you to hear me just preaching truth at you today without compassion i don't want you to feel like this he's just hammering us with this is what the bible says this is what the bible says and he doesn't care for me that's not true that's not true if we were in a one-on-one counseling situation i sure hope i would do a good job of caring for you in fact it's probably a good PSA for everybody in the crowd today. When you come up alongside people who are hurting, you have to care for them before you can just hit them with the truth. Well, this is what it said. This is what the Bible says. Here's the truth. They might not be ready to accept that. They need to know that you care. I do have care and empathy, and yet I find myself that I have today is to preach the truth to you. I don't get the opportunity to care for each individual person right now. I'm gonna preach the truth, and I hope I do it with compassion that bleeds through. What I have for you today, I don't have any easy answers, because there aren't easy answers to these questions. If you expected an easy fix, there isn't one. In fact, what I have for you are four difficult truths. And I wanna acknowledge that if you're hurting today, if you feel like I'm lost, God doesn't listen to me. If you're hurting today, I don't think that you're probably going to be able to grapple with all four truths at the same time. I would suggest that you try to grab a hold of one, one truth, internalize it, make it practical, get some traction and start to take some steps forward. Just one out of four. Now, if you sit in the crowd today and you say, honestly, like, I feel good, everything, like life is going smooth. This has been such a great season for me. My relationship with God is good. I don't feel any of these things right now. I wanna encourage you, don't tune out. Don't say this message isn't for me, I guess. It absolutely is for you and here's why. Because Jesus promises that as long as we walk this earth, we're gonna face troubles of many kinds. Troubles are an absolute guarantee. So if your life is smooth sailing right now, great, but it's not gonna stay that way forever. Life isn't sunshine and rainbows. Trouble comes, I'm not trying to be ominous, I'm not trying to be threatening, but trouble comes. It's a guarantee for us. So if you find yourself in a good situation right now where you're like, I'm not emotional about this, maybe you can take in more truth than the average person in the room today. You would be a wise person to lean forward and say, okay, I'm gonna get everything I can out of this and brace myself for what's inevitably coming, all right? We're gonna jump into these truths. There's four of them, and so we gotta move semi-quickly through them. The first one is this, pain leads us to depend on God. There is a special closeness that we can experience with God in the middle of seasons of pain. Some of you have felt it. Some of you in seasons where you know like, man, when everything else feels shaky, the only solid ground I know is Jesus. When everything else feels like it's taken from me, the only place I know to turn is Jesus and you've experienced some closeness with him. Pain has a way of putting a fork in the road in front of us. We have a choice. Do we run toward God and get comfort? Do we run away from God and say, if this is what God brings into my life, I don't want anything to do with him. You get angry at God. And some of you have been angry. Some of you are angry. You hear truth, somebody might hit you over the head with the truth, Romans 8, I totally believe this is true. It's absolutely true. We know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love him. He's gonna work it all out. He's got a big plan. Everything has a purpose. But if somebody doesn't show care for you in the middle of your hurt, and they just hit you over the head with Romans 8, it might say, fine, fine, God has a big plan. But like, what does that do for me? I get that he's working out some cosmic plan, but he's indifferent to me in the in-between. He doesn't care about me. And the scriptures are so clear. The answer is absolutely not. Of course he cares about you. He loves you like a father loves his kids. Psalm 34 says this, that he's close to the brokenhearted. So if you find yourself today with ache in your heart, loss, grief, hurt, loneliness, doubt, fear, he wants to be so close to you. The father wants to wrap his arms around you. It says he rescues those whose spirits are crushed. We serve a God who wants to be near to us. He does care about us. He's not indifferent to us in the middle. We serve a God who wants to be near to us. He does care about it. He's not indifferent to us in the middle. But you might say, so then, okay, if he cares for me, then why does he allow the pain in the first place? Why is there so much pain? Why do bad things happen? That's a big question. It's something that every Christian, in fact, everybody has to grapple with at some point, the problem with pain. I can't unpack that. I'm not smart enough to do it anyway. C.S. Lewis wrote a great book called The Problem with Pain, if you want to get really deep and dive into it. Today, what I have for you instead is a story. When my oldest son was only a few months old, he was getting a lot of ear infections, and he had to have that ear tube surgery, right? And so, like, lots of you have experienced that, or your kids have. And you know it's not a big deal. It's like a quick in and out procedure. It's not risky. It's gonna benefit him. But he doesn't know, he's a little kid. He's months old. I can't explain that to him. All he knows is that I've handed him off to some strangers in white coats and they put him on a cart and they wheel him down a hallway with fluorescent lights in his face and they wheel him into some kind of scary and he's crying, and he's reaching out like he just wants mom and dad. I would do anything to be able to explain to him, buddy, it's gonna be okay. It's gonna work out. It's not even gonna hurt. Like, it's gonna be fine. We'll get you back really soon. We're not giving you away forever to these scary people. But I can't explain that. The gap in our understanding is too great. It's not that I'm withholding. It's not that I don't want to care for him. In fact, I want to do every, if I could have just grabbed him and held him and made him feel better, I would have done it. It's not that I'm indifferent in the in-between. I just see a bigger picture. And God cares for us similarly. He does see the big picture. He is working a bigger plan, He is working a bigger plan, but he's not indifferent to you in the middle. He wants to be close to you, and there is a special closeness when the Father wraps you up in his arms. There's a deeper relationship that you get to experience. There's going to come a day where pain won't matter anymore. Pain doesn't have a purpose anymore. On the other side of this life, there won't be any grief or loss or suffering or death or disease. But in the meantime, pain is part of the pathway that leads us to God. It teaches us to depend on Him when we don't have anything else. Lean into Him, don't run away from Him, run toward Him in seasons of pain. The next truth is this, trials produce good character in us. Ever since Jenna was diagnosed with MS, God has brought this verse into my head and it's like I'm not learning the lesson because He won't let me move past it. Over and over, James chapter 1, and it says this, Dear brothers and sisters, when troubles of any kind come your way, consider it an opportunity for great joy. Great joy? For real? Great joy? Like, I'll just consider bad things to be good things? When was the last time somebody said like, hey, how was your day? And joy? Like, I'll just consider bad things to be good things? When was the last time somebody said, like, hey, how was your day? And you're like, it was terrible. Everything went wrong, and it was awesome. It was such a great opportunity for joy. Nobody does that. We don't do that. Why would I do that? I don't want this stuff in my life. God, why would I consider it great joy? And James goes on, he says, this is why. Because you know that when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow, so let it grow. For when your endurance is fully developed, you'll be perfect, complete, needing nothing. The reason we consider trials to be an opportunity for great joy is because they produce results in us. Think about it for a second. If I got a direct and immediate answer to every prayer I ever prayed, I would be living a life, a selfish life, one of just comfort and security and affluence for myself. I would be an insufferable person to be around. I would be an immature person. I wouldn't look a thing like Jesus. My ego would be out of control. That's not what God wants for us. God is a good father. He knows, just like any good father knows, that it's not a good idea for his kids to call all the shots. I've stood on this stage multiple times and delivered sermons. I've told you stories about a broken childhood. I told you stories about my marriage almost ending. I'm telling you today about my wife having MS. Like, these aren't, you think I'd ask for these things? You think I'd ask for these things? You think I'd pray for this? I didn't ask for any of this. And yet they are the things that have made me depend on Jesus the most. They are the things that produce in me Christ-like character in a very real way. They're the things that drove me to know and love Jesus in the first place. I can't remove them from my story. God knows what's best for us. I've come to believe this quote from Tim Keller, the late Tim Keller. He passed away earlier this year. Great pastor, great author. He writes, he sort of argues that God answers every prayer. There's no prayer that God doesn't answer. He's either going to give us what we asked for in prayer, or he's going to give us what we would have asked for if we knew everything he knows. He answers every prayer. He gives us what we need. It's not always what we want. Sometimes it's trials that produce good character in us. He's driving us toward growth. He knows that we need adversity to grow. He made us to conquer challenges, to overcome obstacles. You can do hard things. In fact, hard things are necessary. They're good for us. They don't always feel good for us, but they are good for us because they produce results. And don't miss this. If we jump back into James 1, James says, you know when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. It's not a guarantee. Troubles are a guarantee. Jesus guarantees troubles, and James says, but growth, that's a choice. You gotta do your part. You gotta let it grow. You have to lean into those seasons. I don't know if you've ever had a season where you've just sort of like hardship has come and you just sort of plugged your ears to it. La, la, la, la, la, la. I'll just push through the season. I'll try not to think about it. I'll pour myself into work so I don't out to it. And you know what good fathers do when you get to the end of the road and you didn't learn the lesson? They start you back over at the beginning. And you have to walk the same broken path again. You're going to learn the lesson sooner or later. It's to your benefit to choose growth now, to say, you know what? This season of in-between might be leading me somewhere after all. It might be producing good character in me. It might be refining me to look more like Jesus. And guys, that's the point of life, to be like Jesus. I'm a dad. I care for my two boys. I want them to be happy, but happiness isn't everything. I want them more than anything to grow up to be great young men that act like Jesus, that know and love Jesus. They have a relationship with him. I'm concerned more with ultimately their holiness than their happiness, and God is the same way. He's not an angry killjoy kind of God who never wants you to be happy. He's not just bringing trials into your life and laughing maniacally about it. Happiness is fine, but he cares about your holiness. Holiness is a bigger deal. The next difficult truth, and these are difficult. These are hard to swallow. Take in what truth you can. You might not be able to get all of it. The third difficult truth is this. What Jesus has done for us is already enough. What Jesus has done is already enough. There's this Hebrew word, dayenu, and Jewish people at a traditional Passover meal would sing a song called dayenu, it translates to it would have been enough. And they sit around the table, Jewish people, they don't believe in Jesus as the Messiah, so they don't have the New Testament that we have. They do have the same Old Testament, and so you'll recognize some of the stories, but they sit around the Passover table and they sing a song, and they sing things like, God, had you delivered us from Egypt but not parted the Red Sea for us, it would have been enough. If you parted the Red Sea for us and led us across on dry ground but didn't crash the waves back down and deliver us from our enemies, it would have been enough. If you did lead us through and deliver us from our enemies but didn't provide manna for us in the desert to sustain us all those years, it would have been enough. They're retraining their perspective to say, we don't deserve any of this. I'm not entitled to the good things that God does for me. I'm certainly in no place to demand anything from him. They're saying, God, if you would have done this much for me, that would already be enough, but you go further. And if you would have only done that, that would be over and beyond enough for me. But you go further. You never stop blessing. It retrains their perspective toward gratitude. Imagine for a second Jesus singing this song at the Passover table with his disciples. This song wasn't written for like a thousand years after Jesus walked the earth. So they didn't actually sit down and sing. But just imagine for a second what it would be like. Because there's special significance for us, New Testament believers in Jesus. They would have sat around and said, if you would have just parted the Red Sea, if you would have just delivered us from our enemies, if you would have just provided man, if you would have given us the law, if you'd have given us the prophets table that would know none of that is enough. If that was enough, I wouldn't be here. Only the cross is enough. It wouldn't matter if he parted the Red Sea, if he delivered them, if he provided for them, if he gave us every good thing that we ever wanted on this earth, if he provided for every need for us, but never made a way to atone for our sins, never made a way for us to have closeness with the Father, never secured our future in heaven. None of it would be enough. And Jesus sits at that table and knows only the cross is enough. Romans 5 says it like this, when we were utterly helpless, totally broken, completely unable to make a move toward God, no merit to boast about on our own, Christ came at just the right time and he died for us sinners, us messed up people. And then Paul goes on, he says, now most people wouldn't be willing to die for an upright person, though someone, not just anybody, might perhaps, but probably not, be willing to die for a person who's especially good. You see all the qualifiers that Paul's putting on. He's saying, people don't, who does this? Nobody's dying for the broken outcast. No one's dying for the rejected, dirty sinners. Nobody does this. And yet God shows his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners. He does it. John 15 says, there's no greater love than that. The one who lays down his life for his friends. Jesus doesn't even call us sinners. He does it. John 15 says, there's no greater love than that. The one who lays down his life for his friends. Jesus doesn't even call us sinners. He calls us friends. This is what he does for us. This is incredible grace. This is not something I deserve. If the remainder of my life were marked by hardship and sorrow only, if I never got another good thing for the rest of my days, what he's done for me would already be so much more than I deserve. And yet he goes beyond that. He doesn't just give us the cry. My life isn't marked just by sorrow and hardship. There are hard days. There are hard things, but he gives me so much more. He blesses my life. He's given me so many things to be thankful for. His word says that his mercies are new for me every morning. In other words, every day I have an opportunity to get up and say, there are an outrageous amount of things to be grateful to God for right now, none of which I deserve. We can retrain our brains around gratitude in that way. Those three truths sort of lead us to the last one, okay? It sort of culminates here. If you've allowed pain in your life to push you toward dependence on God and you have a deeper relationship with him, if you're saying, okay, it's difficult, but I'm allowing trials to produce good character in me, I see that I'm a different person because God has sharpened me through a refining fire. If you're retraining your brain to say, God, I have every reason to be grateful and no reason to be entitled and whining and griping. I should be grateful because what you've done is already enough. It leads us to our last truth and it's this, he's worthy of praise no matter what. You'll never walk a day on this earth when he's not worth worshiping, where his glory is somehow diminished to the point where you don't need to worship him. Oh, it's just commonplace. I'm used to it. No, it's not. There's never a day where he's not worthy of worship. In Daniel chapter three, we find three young Hebrew men and they've been exiled from their home. The nation of Israel has been captured by the nation of Babylon. They're under King Nebuchadnezzar. They're enslaved. And Nebuchadnezzar puts up a golden statue and says, from now on, don't worship the God of the Bible anymore. No more Hebrew God, no more Yahweh. You need to worship this golden statue that I set up. And these three young Hebrew men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, they refuse to do it. They continue to worship the God of the Bible. And for that, they receive a death sentence. They're scheduled to be thrown into a fiery furnace so hot that when the guards go to throw them in, the guards are immediately incinerated. And right before they go to what would look like their death, this is what they say. They say, if we're thrown into the blazing furnace, the God whom we serve is able to save us. He's able to do it. He can do it. And in fact, we believe he will rescue us from your power, your majesty. But even if he doesn't, we wanna make it clear to you that we'll never serve your gods or worship the gold statue that you've set up. We think he's able. We think he's gonna do it, but even if he doesn't, I'm not gonna stop worshiping. That even if faith, that stubborn faith, that's what we ought to be trying to develop. That's what we need. We need even if faith, not if faith, not if you answer the prayer the way I want, I'll worship you. If you do what i want in the timing that i want it if it someday makes sense to me if things turn out good for me then i'll believe you're good then i'll worship you not if faith even if faith even if the worst happens even if everything seems to be taken from me even if i can't make sense of it i choose to worship you that's the kind of faith that we're after even if faith stubborn faith and over ms for my family for my wife i say even if even if it takes something from us that's impossible to deal with like even if the worst happens even if the unthink even if i have to walk a road that is unthinkable to me right now even if i won't back down i'm not going to quit worshiping i'm going to choose to lean into closeness with God in the middle of pain. I'm going to choose to experience growth through trials to become more like Jesus. I'm going to recognize that what God's already done for me is more than enough, and I'm going to worship him. Period. Full stop. Nothing is going to deter me from it. I've come to believe that God gets like super maxed out glory from even if faith. I don't know exactly how it works. I know that God doesn't work the way I work. If I were God, I would do things differently. Praise God, I'm not him. I've wondered before, like if God wants more glory, if he wants more followers, why doesn't he just like do a global miracle? Why doesn't he cure cancer? He could cure cancer globally and prove to everybody that he's a powerful God, that he's a benevolent God, and everybody would follow him. Who wouldn't follow him? But it sort of takes some of the faith out of it, doesn't it? Jesus says, blessed are those people that believe even though they don't see, even though they don't see, even though they don't see all the flashy miracles and signs, they believe anyways. They have a stubborn faith. Even if I don't see it, I choose to believe. I've come to believe myself that rather than a big global spectacle, God somehow gets more glory from the woman who lays in her hospital bed and cancer has ravaged her body and the chemo's not working. And she says know what even if it doesn't work even if i never get out of this hospital bed again even if i'm not going to see my family much longer i choose to worship him because he's worthy of praise no matter what and i know on the other side of this life i'm going to see him face to face and all this stuff is going to pass away and this is worth it i choose to worship him even if. We see that kind of stubborn faith in the remainder of these song lyrics that we're gonna jump back to, okay? I don't know if you know, there's a word in music, it's called a refrain. Do you know what a refrain is? It's like in this song in particular, there are verses and then there's a refrain, like a repeated part that keeps coming back. The verses change, but the refrain remains the same. And it's true for our lives as well. Seasons of your life are gonna change. There's gonna be ups and downs, but the refrain remains the same. This is the refrain of the song. It says, rejoice, rejoice. I'm choosing to praise you anyways, God. I'm choosing to praise you no matter what. Emmanuel, the God who's with me, I don't even see you right now. I feel sometimes distant from you, but I'm choosing to run toward you, not away from you. I'm gonna cling to you in the midst of this. I worship you, the God who's with me. And this is what really blows me away. They say, rejoice, rejoice. Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel. The promise that you're gonna come and save us, we believe it. Even though 400 400 years of silence have happened. What reason do we have to be optimistic about this anymore? Everything about like just logic and reason would tell us, I don't know, maybe he's never coming. Maybe this is all made up. They choose to say, no, I'm worshiping you through it no matter what. I believe you're gonna come and take care of me. I know you're gonna come through because you're the God who loves me. You're the God who keeps his promises. you're gonna come through because you're the God who loves me. You're the God who keeps his promises. We choose to believe it even when we don't see it. That's what faith is. Hebrews 11 says, faith is confidence in what we hope for. It's this deep rooted assurance about what we don't see. Even when we can't see it, we say, even if. And so again, for my family, like, I don't know how it's gonna work. Maybe Jenna will be healed next week. Maybe some of you will pray for her and she'll be healed next week or next month or next year or sometime, and I'll praise God for it. That'd be amazing. But no matter what, I know this, she's gonna be healed in this life or the next. Someday she will be. I don't see it yet. I have no guarantees. I can't prove it. I choose to believe it. Worship is going to be my refrain. In every season of life, in highs and lows, I'm going to come back and say, he's worthy of praise no matter what. I'm not going to quit. So what's your next step? What's your next step for the in-between? This first one is really about closeness with God. If you feel like, man, right now, God just feels so distant, I pray and I don't know where he's at, let me give you a really good piece of advice. When God seems silent, his word never is. His word continues to speak. This would be a fantastic time to dive into the word of God. And you might say, I'm not interested in like a bunch of Christian cliches or like the Bible's just, you know, I don't know that the Bible can speak to my real life. It seems so old and distant from, it's not like that at all. Here's from Psalm 22. The author says, my God, my God, why have you abandoned me? Why are you so far away when I groan for help? Every day I call to you, God, but you don't answer. Every night I lift my voice, but I find no relief. The Bible's not oblivious to the way that you feel. If you go to the text, you're not gonna find a sanitized book. It's a raw and real and honest book. You're gonna find your emotions of anger and hurt and abandonment. You're gonna find those things reflected back to you in the text, and I promise you, because I've seen it happen over and over and over again, too many times to deny, you're gonna find that the word comes alive and gives you guidance and gives you comfort for your real life. Go to the word. And also, don't feel like you're less spiritual. If you don't know where to start in the Bible, just go to Google and say, scriptures to read when I'm feeling blank. That doesn't make you less the hen. There's no problem. Just go to Google and figure it out, okay? But dive into his word. If you feel like he's distant, his word speaks even when he seems silent. The next one's about growth. Maybe you have been numbing yourself out. You've been trying to just push through a season and you haven't been learning the lesson because you're just trying to ignore it. Sometimes we talk about, you know, when you come come into church you leave your problems at the door right and you just you sing the songs but then you pick them back up you pick them back up and you just go back to your regular life maybe you need to not push the things away maybe you need to lean into it in the season maybe you recognize you know what i've been numbing myself my alcohol intake has increased i've been numbing myself with pornography or mindless scrolling on my phone, or I dive into work so that I don't have to deal with problems elsewhere, whatever it is. If you're numbing, this might be a season to say, okay, God teach me. I don't wanna have to learn the same lesson over and over again. I don't wanna go back to the beginning again. I wanna grow, I wanna be dead honest with, tell them everything, pour your soul out to them, and say, dude, I need you to walk through this with me. I need you to be the person that asks me tough questions. I need to be able to have some honest response from you because I wanna grow. I don't wanna numb myself out anymore. I don't wanna turn to things that aren't Jesus on this. I know when I turn to Jesus, he's gonna be faithful to do a good work in me, so I'm gonna grow in this season. Maybe it's gratitude. Maybe you need to work that dayenu idea into your daily routine. You know, you sit down and you eat a meal and you think, I mean, if you would have just given me this food, that would have been enough. But you gave me like choices. I could have had any kind of food that I wanted and you give me choices beyond that. You give me a lot of freedom in life and that would be enough. And you've given me, like think about all the blessings that God's done. Just go further and further and further and see if it can like end where it's like more than anything, you gave me Jesus and that's enough. Put them on Post-it notes and stick them all over the place. Journal at the end of the day, make it a lock screen on your whatever you have to do to put gratitude in front of you and start to retrain your perspective around gratitude. Or maybe, maybe your next step is just to keep showing up when you say, I'm not feeling, I don't wanna go to church today, I don't feel it. I don't wanna sing these songs today, I'm not feeling it. I'm just not in that right frame of mind. Maybe you come here anyways and you sing. Maybe you sing louder. Maybe you sing through the tears. Maybe you sing when it hurts like heck to believe that God is still good in the midst of pain. Maybe it hurts to cling to him when everything else feels shit. Maybe your next step is to just come and continue to be rock steady about the idea, okay, I'm gonna worship you no matter what. Maybe you need to build up an even if kind of faith. My encouragement to you is the same as it was at the beginning of the message. I'd love for you to grab a hold of one of these things. One, just one out of four. Try to make it practical in your life. Try to get some traction and take some steps forward. Nothing will happen if you don't do anything with it. You gotta put it into practice in your life. I'm gonna close with one more story. In John chapter 11, we see a guy, his name's Lazarus. Lazarus is a friend of Jesus, and Lazarus is sick, he's dying, and Jesus gets word, Jesus is several towns over, and Jesus gets word that Lazarus is dying, and he could have just healed him right there, right then and there. He could have answered the prayer, healed him at a distance. We've seen him do it. He has the power to do it. He could have rushed to Lazarus's bedside and laid his hands on him and healed him. We've seen him do it. He has the power to do it. He could have done it, but he doesn't. He doesn't answer the prayer. Lazarus's family is over there, like undoubtedly, it's not in scriptures, but there's no way that they weren't praying, like, God, please save Lazarus. We love him. How do we get by without him? Specifically, his two sisters, like they weren't earning money. Like they needed this male family member in their life. They were desperate for this. God, please save our brother. And God doesn't do anything. Jesus doesn't do anything jesus doesn't move he doesn't make a move he lets lazarus die he waits days and lazarus dies and the funeral starts and the family's grieving and finally after saying some sort of like typical jesus cryptic sort of uh talking in riddles things about no god's really going to get glory through this after days he makes the journey and he starts to come up on this funeral that's already in progress. And one of Lazarus' sisters, Martha, runs out and meets Jesus on the road. And I can imagine what her emotions must be like when she says, I mean, hear this, hear the emotion in this. Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died. Where were you? What could possibly have been more important than this? Why didn't you come? We prayed. We knew you had power. Where were you? And I sort of pictured that she musters up some humility and she says, I know though that even now God will give you whatever you ask. And I used to think like, okay, I get it. Martha already knows that Jesus can raise Lazarus from the dead. And he in fact does. But I don't think that, that doesn't seem to make sense with the text. You keep reading and Jesus says to her, Martha, your brother will rise again. And if she was expecting him to go over and perform a miracle and raise him from the dead, I assume Martha would say, oh, thank God. Let's go raise him right now. That's a huge relief, thank you. But she doesn't, she answers Jesus sort of dejectedly. She says, I know, I know he'll rise again in the resurrection at the last day. I know I'll see him again, like in heaven, someday I'll see him again. But she's hurting, she lost her brother. And Jesus stops this conversation. He says, no, no, no, Martha, I am the resurrection. I am the life. The one who believes in me will live even though they die. Whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this? There was a moment where Martha prayed, God, save my brother. That's the beginning. There's a moment at the end where Jesus heals Lazarus. And as crazy a miracle as that is, it's almost beside the point because you know what happens to Lazarus later? He dies again. They bury him again. They have another funeral for him. It's the middle. It's the in-between where Jesus says, this is how God's really gonna get some glory. You're gonna see me for who I really am. It's in the middle that Martha has an opportunity to see Jesus is up to something bigger than life or death here. He's bigger than it all. He says, no, it's not about do I raise him? Do I not raise him? Was I here on time? Not here on time. I am life. I'm everything. I'm the resurrection. I the life it's in the in between that she gets to see that and my question to you is the same that he asked to her do you believe this do you believe this enough to sustain the waiting to get through the in between to steadfast in a steadfast way worship God to trust him in the in-between, to steadfast, in a steadfast way, worship God, to trust him in the in-between. Do you believe this to the point that you can walk the difficult road of the in-between? Some people, I've heard people say, what good is following? Why do I even want a relationship with God if he's not gonna answer my prayers? If I don't get anything out of it, if he's not gonna do the things that i ask him to do then why am i even in this what what good is it and i'm telling you they're missing it they're missing it i have a relationship with god that's bigger than him answering a prayer like what i have in jesus is bigger than any answered prayer it's worth enduring hardship for i've seen him draw close to me in times of pain enough to know that he loves me. I've seen him turn bad things into good things enough to know he can do it. I've experienced a closeness with him that is like unmatched by any treasure on this earth. And if everything else is taken from me, Jesus will never be taken from me. Praise God. And he is enough. He's enough. Pray with me. Lord, we choose to run to you in the in-between. We choose to come close to you, not running away from you, coming close to you and experiencing a the in-between. We choose to come close to you, not running away from you, coming close to you and experiencing a deeper relationship with you. We want you to make us look more like Jesus, even if it's difficult. We recognize that there's no way we deserve anything that you've given us, and yet you've given us blessing upon blessing. You are abundantly good to us. And for all these reasons and a million more, God, we choose to worship you, even if. At the same time, God, I pray for people who are hurting, who are stuck in the in-between right now. Your word also says that you're the God of all comfort. You comfort us in our time of need. And so, God, I pray that you would, that as we turn to you, we'd experience this peace that goes beyond our understanding. We'd experience the joy of just our salvation, not joy of all the extra stuff added on, just the basics of what you've done for us is enough. So God, we run to you. We know that you're faithful to meet us when we run to you. When we take a step toward you, you take a step toward us. God, thank you for who you are and all that you've done. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen."}]}

Tons of you have already signed up, but spots are limited. So if you've been hesitant, sign up right now. Maybe some of you need some clarification on what Man Camp is. A lot of you have been asking on what man camp is a lot of you have been asking me questions and it seems like you've been on some interesting weekend retreats with a bunch of dudes I'm getting questions like will we be singing songs and holding hands or well we need to get in touch with our inner spirit animal I'm a wolf hawk myself or are we gonna have group therapy sessions seriously guys let me give you a better idea of what man camp will be like. Yes, no! Is anybody gonna race? Hey! Hey! What the fuck? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. DJ, turn it up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 11, and you're halfway there. We'll see you, man. Thank you. I'm the guy who gets to plan Man Camp, and as the guy who's planning it, I can neither confirm nor deny whether Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger will be there, but just saying, you've got to show up to find out, so you will not be disappointed. In all seriousness, though, some of the greatest relationships, friendships I have ever had have started because of some shared experience. Doing something stupid with people that I didn't even know, something crazy, we're laughing at the same things. It's just a shared experience that we have. And I'll tell you, it will be stupid, all right? There will be laughter, there will be fun. There will be so much stuff. But ultimately, our goal is that you would be challenged at Man Camp to build some of those relationships, but to also build your relationship with Jesus, to press into what God wants for you as a father, as a husband, as a man, as a fearless follower of Jesus who's trying to change the world. So if you haven't signed up for Man Camp, I'll tell you there are, as of this morning, there are 19 spots left of 100. Sign up, all right? Man Camp promo, over. All right, we're going to do week number four of Jesus Duke. If you've been with us for the last four weeks, my name's Chris. We've been preaching through these different things that Jesus either said or did that were a little bit of a juke, right? They were, you think he's going one direction, but he changes it. He moves the other direction. He does things that are shocking. And today, if you have a Bible, I want you to turn to John 13. Okay, so we're going to look at a story where he does something, in my opinion, that is unbelievably shocking. And the story itself seems pretty underwhelming when we read it here in a second, but we'll get to how shocking it actually was. We're going to look at a Jesus Duke. If you don't know, if you aren't really a church person, you may not know that today is actually Palm Sunday, right? It has nothing to do with this or high fives or anything like that. It has to do with palm branches, all right? So the triumphal entry, if you are following along in your Bible and you're at John 13, in John 12 is when Jesus rides into Jerusalem the week of Passover on a donkey. And if you'll remember, the people shouted, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, welcoming him as the king who's going to come and overthrow the Roman Empire and bring freedom for them. And so they lay down these palm branches on the road. They lay their coats on the road as he rides in on this donkey, and they welcome him in. And that's the beginning of what we call Holy Week in the church, okay? So today is Palm Sunday. It leads through all these things leading up to next Sunday, which is what Andy talked about earlier, of Easter Sunday. So this whole celebration of Holy Week, it's centered around the celebration of Passover, which is a celebration in the Jewish community of when they were delivered out of slavery in Egypt. And so thousands and thousands and thousands of people, including Jesus riding in on a donkey, came to Jerusalem to celebrate this thing, and it's centered around sacrifices. It's centered around celebrating their deliverance from slavery. There's so much symbolism in it in Jesus dying on that Friday night. It's just crazy. But where we find ourselves in John 13, and the story that I want to read, is them on Thursday night celebrating that Passover dinner. So him and his disciples are having a meal together, and this is what it says in John 13, verses 2 through 5. During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him, Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, that he had come from God and was going back to God, he rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, he tied it around his waist. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. That is the shocking story that we're gonna read. Right, it's super underwhelming. Just Jesus washing people's feet, that's all that to read. Right? It's super underwhelming. Just Jesus washing people's feet. That's all that happened in the story. Yes, that is exactly what happened in the story. Here's why I get so excited about this. Because for me, foot washing means something. You may hear that and you're just like, okay, cool. You wash some people's feet. I grew up in the Grace Brethren tradition of church, okay? Something you got to know about the Grace Brethren tradition of church, okay? Something you gotta know about the Grace Brethren is they're weird, number one. Number two, they do a lot of cool things, all right? So I like to joke, they baptize people, they dunk them three times, the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, so I'm actually three times more saved than any of you. But like, they do just interesting things, that's totally not true, just in case you're weird on baptism theology. That's not true at all. But they do a lot of things, and what they do surrounding what we call communion or the Lord's Supper, when they have the bread and the wine or Welch's grape juice, that they don't celebrate that or do that on Sunday mornings. They do it at a separate time. They had an entire separate meal where the entire church, it wasn't a huge church, about 70 people, would get together for basically a potluck. But then you would, at some point in the night, you would take communion together. But before that, the guys would get up and the girls would get up and they would go to separate places for the foot washing ceremony. So when I read this story, it brings back literal names, faces, people. I remember Pastor Al. He was the pastor of that church. He was 6'7\". He played basketball in college for the Citadel. He's this massive, like, giant, kind, loving dude. And I can remember him, even before I grew up in this church, I remember this huge guy getting down on his knees and washing my feet. It's this interesting ceremony where, starting with the pastor and the elders, we would all go into a room. There would be these white towels with blue little stripes on the bottom. They would go. Everybody would take their shoes off. You're sitting in a circle. It's getting awkward already, right? And they would take water that you hoped had been poured like pretty recently so that it was warm instead of freezing cold. They would pour it into a basin, and then they would take that towel, tie it around their waist. They would kneel down, wash your feet. You would both stand up. The person who washed, you would hug each other. Then you would, in not COVID-appropriate style in any way, take off that same towel, pass it to that person, they'd wash the next person's feet, right? It's pretty gross, actually, when you think about it, but that moment, that brings back, like, I can think of Al Edgington, I can think of Nathan Bunce, Gary Fouts, these people, like, these old men in our church washing my feet, and as I sat through that, looking back on it now, I'm like, that blows me away. As I sat through that looking back on it now I'm like that blows me away as I sat through that I hated it because my feet smell bad is it anybody else have this problem right like nobody's raising their head you liars right like there is something about my feet like I'm gonna walk around today just like all of you and somehow my feet will be 20 times worse than anyone else. It's like when I just, I really like, I'm insecure about the way that my feet smell. It's just like, oh, I do not wanna do this. Even when I was younger, like I don't like my feet being out and especially like people touching my feet. Feet are gross in general. Like some people have like foot fetishes, right? And there's counseling for you. Like that feet are disgusting. It's just known that they are gross. And so like I did not like that ceremony. I hated it. I was always worried about like, oh, well, I mean, I hate people touching my feet. So when I'm washing the guy next to me's feet, like I didn't like that either. Every part of it made me cringe i was like i do not like this and here's what's interesting about it and where i want to push us and challenge us a little bit today and how we're going to look at this story i think there's some keys about something because i was in this ceremony that looking back was a wonderful amazing opportunity for me to to be served by some godly men that loved jesus with everything that they, and they humbled themselves to a point where they would serve me, and I got to participate in that. And I missed out on what God had for me in those moments because I was too worried about what everybody else in the room was thinking of me. And I wonder how many of you and how many of us live our lives, and even in religious moments we are so consumed by the approval and the opinions of other people that we miss out on what God wants to do in your life. I laugh about this because I can't help but laugh all morning as I'm thinking about what I'm about to say, moments are happening where I'm tempted to miss out on what's going on because of the opinions of others. This dude doesn't know I'm going to say this, but this dude right over here in this purple shirt walked by a window about 45, maybe like an hour ago now, and I was practicing my sermon in Andy's office. There's a big window out of the parking lot. He walks right past the window. Like, I make eye contact with him. He makes eye contact with me. It was weird. I was like, I don't know who this dude is. This is so odd. And I start getting insecure as I'm literally opening my mouth to talk about how all of us struggle with insecurity about what everyone else thinks. I'm about to go preach about it. All of us are so enslaved to the opinions of other people the approval of other people maybe you're here today and you're trying to engage in worship but but you know you have a terrible voice that's okay but i guarantee you some of you missed out on the opportunity to worship Jesus because you're like, well, I don't want this guy next to me to hear how terrible my voice is. And the whole time, instead of praising Jesus, you are hoping that that person isn't hearing what you're singing. Maybe there's some of you in here right now. You're just consumed with what the person next to you thinks. Like, did I wear the right thing? Like, some of you are walking in being like, I don't know, am I okay to be in this church? Maybe you're new here and you're like, you're wearing like really nice clothes and you realize like the guy up here is wearing just like jeans and like all blue and looks a little weird. Like, you're like, oh, I dressed up way too much for this. And you might miss what God has to say to you because you're too consumed with what everyone else is thinking. We are never free from this enslavement. All day, every day, we are consumed with what people think of us. And I think if we look into this pretty boring story here, we're gonna see something about Jesus that could change your life. Because this is a Jesus juke for a couple reasons. Number one, this task is gross. It's gross. If anybody had reason to be insecure about the way that other people viewed them, it was Jesus in this story. Because you don't know anything about foot washing back then foot washing was reserved for the lowest of low of low low low slaves the person who was chosen to wash the feet of people coming in to a house off the streets it's like a slap in the face to you saying if you thought you were not up here before you are way down at the very bottom of the totem pole. No one is beneath you. The reason being that it's a gross job. It's terrible. I sort of said this, but this is the week of Passover. The streets back then are pretty dirty already, but bring in thousands and thousands and thousands more people into a city, Bring in thousands and thousands and thousands more people into a city. Celebrating a holiday that involves killing tons and tons and tons of animals to offer as sacrifices. You know what happens when you add thousands and thousands and thousands of animals into a city? Thousands and thousands and thousands of presents on the street for all to enjoy. If you ever walk behind an animal, right, they just let it go, right? There's no highways for people and then highways for animals. It's just that's basically what the road becomes. Back then, it's like there's just feces everywhere. And on a normal day, you can see something and sort of just be like, all right, well, I'm going to sidestep that. But when there's thousands more people, the streets are packed, it is everywhere, you cannot help but get your feet in that, and in this story, Jesus, he sees the disciples, and he washes their feet, they're going to take their sandals off, I'm sure that's fine, but they've got literal crap on their feet, and he's washing it off. their feet and he's washing it off. I got insecure about, man, I got to wash these guys' feet that are pretty clean, honestly, and like, I don't like that. This is beyond disgusting. And to us, we've heard about Jesus washing people's feet so it doesn't shock us, but his disciples, and you see it in the story, you see when he goes to wash Peter's feet, Peter freaks out. And he sort of says what everybody else is thinking, like, no, you, you, you are the one that just rode in on a donkey. People laid their coats down to be walked on because of you. You're the king. You're the one that's gonna come come and conquer, you are way up here, you're not down here, you're not this person, like, what are you doing? They would have thought, all these thoughts about him, they would have, he had a reason to worry about what other people were gonna think, yet he doesn't care at all. And here's why I think he doesn't care, and it's the second reason that this story is unbelievable to me, is that Jesus knows God's plan. If you focus on verse 3, I'm going to read again, and I'm going to emphasize some things here. Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from God and was going back to God, he rose from supper. Knowing that God had given all things to him, that he was coming from the Father and was going back to the Father, he washed the disciples' feet. He knew. He knew God's plan. And now there's a lot of weirdness surrounding Jesus being fully God and fully man. And how much did he know? Could he tell the future? Is he a prophet? All these things that we think about when it comes to the life of Jesus, we cannot answer all those things today. But I do know multiple things about Jesus in this moment. It tells us that he knew what was happening, that he knew his past. He knew he had come from God, which means he could remember, at least in some way, that he was there when God spoke the world into being. He was there when the first second on a clock ticked, when time itself was created. He was there when he put everything together on the earth, in the stars. Jesus was there, and he knew it. He knew that he had come from God and he knew that he was going back to God. He knew the plans of God. He knew the prophecies. He memorized them as a little boy about the way that he would die. He knew that he was about to get whipped, beaten. He knew that he would get his head pierced. He knew that all the blood was going to be all over him because there's so many prophecies about blood and Jesus. He knew he was the Messiah, but he knows that he's going back to the Father. He knows that at some point, a matter of days from now, he'll be sitting at the right hand of God, ruling and reigning for all eternity. He knew that in his mind, but he also knows that Peter is about to betray him. I know that because he says it. He predicts it verses later. He knows that Judas is going to basically turn him over to the authorities because he says it here in this chapter. Jesus knew the plan of God. And knowing the plan of God, knowing that all of his friends were going to run away like cowards after he was brutally murdered unjustly, knowing that Judas is going to be the one that turns him in and knowing that Peter is going to betray him because he cares too much about the thoughts of a little girl. Knowing all of that, he washes their feet. He doesn't have to. If he never does a thing here, it just wouldn't be included in scripture, he'd still die on the cross. He'd still go to the grave. He'd still raise from the dead. We'd still be celebrating Easter. He doesn't have to do it, yet he does it. And I'll tell you, this is me, and I know what's coming next, and I know how terrible the next three days of my life are going to be. I'm going to have one response. This is probably uncool if the pastor says, I'm going to be like, hey, can I get more of that wine over here? Because it's about to get pretty dark in here, right? Like, give me some more bread, give me some more wine. We're going to hang out here for a while. I'm going to put this off as long as I possibly can. I'm just going to chill. I'm not jumping in to this too quickly here, because I know what's about to happen. Yet, him, in the face of what is coming at him, he steps down and takes the lowest position that he possibly can, and he serves his followers and teaches them one last lesson. Above all, you've got to serve people. He shows the very lesson that so many of us struggle to understand. He shows like, hey, you're worth me dying for, but you're also worth me serving. You're worth me doing the lowest of low tasks for you because you matter that much to me. And I say it this way, what Jesus understood, he knew who he was, he knew his position, and when you know where you stand, it's easier to kneel. When you know where you stand, even take it out with God, when you know where you stand, even take it out of the, with God, like, when you know where you stand with a person, you don't have to put up that facade. You don't have to worry about everything they're thinking. It's easier for you to serve them. But especially when you know what God thinks of you, it's much easier to submit yourself to his plans, to his purposes for you, to the things that he calls us to do that are difficult, to the things that would cause us to be looked at a little bit differently. When you know where you stand with him, it's much easier for you to kneel. But the problem that almost all of us have, and it's the problem that I had as a young kid getting my feet washed, as a young kid, getting my feet washed. So many of us are too wrapped up in what other people think of us. And not what God thinks of us. Not how he views us. We don't allow his sacrifice on the cross to define our worth. We allow everybody else's thoughts and opinions to define who we are and how we live. And we don't do certain things. Some of you, you know what God has called you to do. Maybe it's in your parenting. You know what you should do. You know what the Bible tells you to do. But then you have this other person called mom. And she disagrees with the way you do X, Y, or Z, probably A through Z is what she disagrees with. But you bow to her opinions and you want her approval so you don't do what you know God has called you to do in the way that you raise your kids. Maybe it's at your job. You know what God has called you to do. You know you're supposed to have integrity, but there's this boss, and his opinion matters more to you than doing what is right. And I could go by every single scenario, every situation, but I don't have to because you already know it. So many of us, we allow everybody else's opinions to define us. And this is a question I want you to ask yourself. And I'm going to pause after I ask it, because I want you to really think about it and consider this. How much time, energy, and effort do you spend seeking the approval of others? If you really had to calculate it, how much? Maybe if you took your calendar out and you look at it, you'd say, well, it's not that much. Let's take it more to up here. Out of the practical action items, but hey, maybe we think about how much mental energy do you spend thinking about the approval of others? I don't know if any of you have ever had a medical test done where you're sort of like waiting for the results to come back. And the anxiety that that produces, depending on the level of intensity of that test, like you don't know. The not knowing is almost worse than you're just like, I want this to be over. I would rather have an answer. Even if it's a bad answer, even if it's bad, I want to know what it is because that anxiety kills us. And every single day, all day. All of us are walking around waiting for the test results of every single interaction we have with other people. Do they like me? Am I approved? What do they think? Do they value me? Do they love me? Do they care about me? What about that interaction I just had? Did I boost myself in their eyes or, oh, I really messed that up. I should have said this a different way. You think back to the conversation that you've had and you're like oh i really said that and that was stupid that's me all day every day everything i say i have to worry about all these things because i'm held captive to what you are thinking about me even right now i have to worry about not thinking about what you are thinking about the way that i'm putting together each and every sentence that i say we are all in it all day, every single day, seeking the approval of other people, and it is crushing some of you. And you're asking this question in your mind, how do others view me? And instead of God's plans for your life directing where you go it's everybody else's plans that direct how you spend your time how you dress how you talk how you think how you act and you will live life that way how you think, how you act. And you will live life that way, enslaved to everybody else's opinions until you start to get a clear picture of how God views you. You're asking the wrong question. You should be asking this one. How does God view me? And for some of you in the room, this actually made it worse. And if it made it worse for you, I think you have a wrong understanding of how God views you. See, I think some of us, we sit here all day, every day, and we think this is what God thinks about us. We even think that this is what everyone else, we see ourselves as failures. We see ourselves as unwanted, rejected. Like we're a mistake. We're not worth people's time. We're either a has-been or a never-will-be. Our greatest accomplishments will never outweigh our greatest flaws. And so when it comes to what we think, everyone thinks of us including God, that's how we feel, and if that is how you feel today, I want to beg you, I want to just plead with you, I think you couldn't be more wrong, you're letting something define you that is ultimately completely false. Because this is what, this is what God would say about you. The greatest declaration of how much you are worth was made, it's about five days from now we're gonna celebrate it. You are worth the blood of his son. And you will be held captive to what everyone else thinks of you until you start to read the things that God says about you. And when you start to think about how does God view me and you start to actually educate yourself on what it means to be someone who confesses that I am pretty worthless on my own, but Jesus, but Jesus went to the cross and declared how much I'm worth, and so now when God looks at me, he doesn't even look at me, he looks at Jesus, and let's talk for a second about what the Bible says about the way the Father views Jesus. He says, this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. He calls you beloved son. He calls you beautiful daughter. You're deserving of love. You're deserving of affirmation. You are deserving of a seat at the table, the table that you think, I could never get there. He says, here's the best seat I've saved for you. He says you are clean. He says you are clean. He says you are chosen. He says you are holy. You are a priesthood. You are created for good works to do his praises. He says so much, but the greatest declaration he made is on that cross when the last drop of blood dripped from his veins. He said you're worth the blood of my son. That's how God views you and your father is just like that dad in the story of the prodigal son he's sitting there looking out waiting he's just waiting for you to come around the corner so he can run after you and say, welcome home. What was lost has been found. I want you to know how God looks at you. I want you to be free from the opinions and the approval of every single other person in this room. You've got to free yourself from it, but the key is you have nothing to do with it. It's all about Jesus and what he did. Trust in him. Give your life to him. And then, all day every day, this is what we're called to do, and this is the hard part. To follow Jesus is to live a life of suffering, sacrifice, and service. It's what we see from Jesus in this passage, it's what we see from Jesus as he goes to the cross and suffers and dies for us and gives his own life and serves us. He came not to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many. And when I say, man, you're going to have this life where you actually are free from something, you're actually also dedicating your life to suffer, to sacrifice, and to serve, and that doesn't sound super great, honestly. But let me point something out to you. So many of you are suffering all day every day because of the way everybody else looks at you. Wouldn't you rather suffer for the sake of the one who suffered for you? So many of you sacrifice all sorts of things so that you can gain the approval of everyone else. Wouldn't you much rather sacrifice your life for the one who sacrifices life for you? So many of you serve other people. You bow to the will of other people. You bow to their plans for you. Wouldn't you rather bow and surrender to what he wants for you, what he has for you? You're already living a life of suffering, sacrifice, and service. Why not surrender to the one who sacrificed everything for you? Today, I want you to do two things from this message. I want you to ask that question, how much time, energy, and effort do I spend seeking the approval of others? And then the second thing is to remind yourself of where you stand with the King of Kings. Get in the Word. Look at the promises. Look at the things He says to you, about you, about Jesus. Remind yourself of where you stand because when you know where you stand, it is so much easier to kneel and to live a life of suffering, sacrifice, and service for the king. Let me pray. God, I thank you for today. I thank you for the opportunity to be here and to be reminded of what you think of us. The cross is such a powerful picture of your love, of your affection for us. And I pray that we would ignore what everyone else is thinking about us, saying about us, feeling about us, conversations we've had this week that were allowing to define us. I pray that we would forget all of that at the foot of the cross and just say, take me, use me, allow me to see and be reminded of how you look at me every single day and then just live accordingly we give our lives to you it's in your son's name that we pray amen amen."}]}
